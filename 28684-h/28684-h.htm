<h2><a name="HENRY_CUYLER_BUNNER" id="HENRY_CUYLER_BUNNER"></a>HENRY CUYLER BUNNER</h2>

<p class="subtitle">(1855-1896)</p>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/cap_t.png" title="" alt="T" width="73" height="73" class="cap" />
<p class="cap_1"><span class="dcap">The</span> position which Henry Cuyler Bunner has come to occupy
in the literary annals of our time strengthens as the days
pass. If the stream of his genius flowed in gentle rivulets,
it traveled as far and spread its fruitful influence as wide as many a
statelier river. He was above all things a poet. In his prose as in
his verse he has revealed the essential qualities of a poet's nature:
he dealt with the life which he saw about him in a spirit of broad
humanity and with genial sympathy. When he fashioned the tender
triolet on the pitcher of mignonette, or
sang of the little red box at Vesey Street,
he wrote of what he knew; and his stories,
even when embroidered with quaint fancies,
tread firmly the American soil of the nineteenth
century. But Bunner's realism never
concerned itself with the record of trivialities
for their own sake. When he portrayed
the lower phases of city life, it was the
humor of that life he caught, and not its
sordidness; its kindliness, and not its brutality.
His mind was healthy, and since
it was a poet's mind, the point upon which
it was so nicely balanced was love: love of
the trees and flowers, love of his little brothers in wood and field,
love of his country home, love of the vast city in its innumerable
aspects; above all, love of his wife, his family, and his friends; and
all these outgoings of his heart have found touching expression in
his verse. Indeed, this attitude of affectionate kinship with the
world has colored all his work; it has made his satire sweet-tempered,
given his tales their winning grace, and lent to his poetry its
abiding power.</p>

<p class="caption smcap">Henry C. Bunner</p>
</div>

<p>The work upon which Bunner's fame must rest was all produced
within a period of less than fifteen years. He was born in 1855 at
Oswego, New York. He came to the city of New York when very
young, and received his education there. A brief experience of business
life sufficed to make his true vocation clear, and at the age of
eighteen he began his literary apprenticeship on the Arcadian.
When that periodical passed away, Puck was just struggling into<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2732" name="page2732">2732</a></span>
existence, and for the English edition, which was started in 1877,
Bunner's services were secured. Half of his short life was spent in
editorial connection with that paper. To his wisdom and literary
abilities is due in large measure the success which has always
attended the enterprise. Bunner had an intimate knowledge of
American character and understood the foibles of his countrymen;
but he was never cynical, and his satire was without hostility.
He despised opportune journalism. His editorials were clear and
vigorous; free not from partisanship, but from partisan rancor, and
they made for honesty and independence. His firm stand against political
corruption, socialistic vagaries, the misguided and often criminal
efforts of labor agitators, and all the visionary schemes of diseased
minds, has contributed to the stability of sound and self-respecting
American citizenship.</p>

<p>Bunner's first decided success in story-telling was 'The Midge,'
which appeared in 1886. It is a tale of New York life in the interesting
old French quarter of South Fifth Avenue. Again, in 'The
Story of a New York House,' he displayed the same quick feeling
for the spirit of the place, as it was and is. This tale first appeared
in the newly founded Scribner's Magazine, to which he has since
been a constant contributor. Here some of his best short stories
have been published, including the excellent 'Zadoc Pine,' with its
healthy presentation of independent manhood in contest with the
oppressive exactions of labor organizations. But Bunner was no believer
in stories with a tendency; the conditions which lie at the root
of great sociological questions he used as artistic material, never as
texts. His stories are distinguished by simplicity of motive; each is
related with fine unobtrusive humor and with an underlying pathos,
never unduly emphasized. The most popular of his collections of
tales is that entitled 'Short Sixes,' which, having first appeared in
Puck, were published in book form in 1891. A second volume came
out three years later. When the shadow of death had already fallen
upon Bunner, a new collection of his sketches was in process of
publication: 'Jersey Street and Jersey Lane.' In these, as in the
still more recent 'Suburban Sage,' is revealed the same fineness of
sympathetic observation in town and country that we have come to
associate with Bunner's name. Among his prose writings there remains
to be mentioned the series from Puck entitled 'Made in
France.' These are an application of the methods of Maupassant to
American subjects; they display that wonderful facility in reproducing
the flavor of another's style which is exhibited in Bunner's verse
in a still more eminent degree. His prose style never attained the
perfection of literary finish, but it is easy and direct, free from sentimentality
and rhetoric; in the simplicity of his conceptions and the
delicacy of his treatment lies its chief charm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page2733" name="page2733">2733</a></span>
Bunner's verse, on the other hand, shows a complete mastery of
form. He was a close student of Horace; he tried successfully the
most exacting of exotic verse-forms, and enjoyed the distinction of
having written the only English example of the difficult Chant-Royal.
Graceful <i>vers de sociÃ©tÃ©</i> and bits of witty epigram flowed from
him without effort. But it was not to this often dangerous facility
that Bunner owed his poetic fame. His tenderness, his quick sympathy
with nature, his insight into the human heart, above all, the
love and longing that filled his soul, have infused into his perfected
rhythms the spirit of universal brotherhood that underlies all genuine
poetry. His 'Airs from Arcady' (1884) achieved a success unusual
for a volume of poems; and the love lyrics and patriotic songs of
his later volume, 'Rowen,' maintain the high level of the earlier
book. The great mass of his poems is still buried in the back numbers
of the magazines, from which the best are to be rescued in a
new volume. If his place is not among the greatest of our time,
he has produced a sufficient body of fine verse to rescue his name
from oblivion and render his memory dear to all who value the
legacy of a sincere and genuine poet. He died on May 11th, 1896, at
the age of forty-one.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_LOVE-LETTERS_OF_SMITH" id="THE_LOVE-LETTERS_OF_SMITH"></a>THE LOVE-LETTERS OF SMITH</h3>

<p class="subtitle">From 'Short Sixes'</p>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="dcap">When</span> the little seamstress had climbed to her room in the
story over the top story of the great brick tenement
house in which she lived, she was quite tired out. If
you do not understand what a story over a top story is, you
must remember that there are no limits to human greed, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2734" name="page2734">2734</a></span>
hardly any to the height of tenement houses. When the man
who owned that seven-story tenement found that he could rent
another floor, he found no difficulty in persuading the guardians
of our building laws to let him clap another story on the roof,
like a cabin on the deck of a ship; and in the southeasterly of
the four apartments on this floor the little seamstress lived.
You could just see the top of her window from the street&mdash;the
huge cornice that had capped the original front, and that served
as her window-sill now, quite hid all the lower part of the story
on top of the top story.</p>

<p>The little seamstress was scarcely thirty years old, but she
was such an old-fashioned little body in so many of her looks
and ways that I had almost spelled her "sempstress," after the
fashion of our grandmothers. She had been a comely body,
too; and would have been still, if she had not been thin and
pale and anxious-eyed.</p>

<p>She was tired out to-night, because she had been working
hard all day for a lady who lived far up in the "New Wards"
beyond Harlem River, and after the long journey home she had
to climb seven flights of tenement-house stairs. She was too
tired, both in body and in mind, to cook the two little chops
she had brought home. She would save them for breakfast, she
thought. So she made herself a cup of tea on the miniature
stove, and ate a slice of dry bread with it. It was too much
trouble to make toast.</p>

<p>But after dinner she watered her flowers. She was never too
tired for that, and the six pots of geraniums that caught the
south sun on the top of the cornice did their best to repay her.
Then she sat down in her rocking-chair by the window and
looked out. Her eyry was high above all the other buildings,
and she could look across some low roofs opposite and see the
further end of Tompkins Square, with its sparse spring green
showing faintly through the dusk. The eternal roar of the city
floated up to her and vaguely troubled her. She was a country
girl; and although she had lived for ten years in New York,
she had never grown used to that ceaseless murmur. To-night
she felt the languor of the new season, as well as the heaviness
of physical exhaustion. She was almost too tired to go to
bed.</p>

<p>She thought of the hard day done and the hard day to be
begun after the night spent on the hard little bed. She thought<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2735" name="page2735">2735</a></span>
of the peaceful days in the country, when she taught school in
the Massachusetts village where she was born. She thought of a
hundred small slights that she had to bear from people better
fed than bred. She thought of the sweet green fields that she
rarely saw nowadays. She thought of the long journey forth and
back that must begin and end her morrow's work, and she wondered
if her employer would think to offer to pay her fare.
Then she pulled herself together. She must think of more
agreeable things or she could not sleep. And as the only agreeable
things she had to think about were her flowers, she looked
at the garden on top of the cornice.</p>

<p>A peculiar gritting noise made her look down, and she saw a
cylindrical object that glittered in the twilight, advancing in an
irregular and uncertain manner toward her flower-pots. Looking
closer, she saw that it was a pewter beer-mug, which somebody
in the next apartment was pushing with a two-foot rule. On top
of the beer-mug was a piece of paper, and on this paper was
written, in a sprawling, half-formed hand:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza ital">
<span class="i0">porter<br /></span>
<span class="i0">pleas excuse the libberty And<br /></span>
<span class="i0">drink it<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The seamstress started up in terror and shut the window. She
remembered that there was a man in the next apartment. She
had seen him on the stairs on Sundays. He seemed a grave,
decent person; but&mdash;he must be drunk. She sat down on her
bed all a tremble. Then she reasoned with herself. The man
was drunk, that was all. He probably would not annoy her further.
And if he did, she had only to retreat to Mrs. Mulvaney's
apartment in the rear, and Mr. Mulvaney, who was a highly
respectable man and worked in a boiler-shop, would protect her.
So, being a poor woman who had already had occasion to excuse&mdash;and
refuse&mdash;two or three "libberties" of like sort, she made
up her mind to go to bed like a reasonable seamstress, and she
did. She was rewarded, for when her light was out, she could see
in the moonlight that the two-foot rule appeared again with one
joint bent back, hitched itself into the mug-handle, and withdrew
the mug.</p>

<p>The next day was a hard one for the little seamstress, and
she hardly thought of the affair of the night before until the
same hour had come around again, and she sat once more by<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2736" name="page2736">2736</a></span>
her window. Then she smiled at the remembrance. "Poor fellow,"
she said in her charitable heart, "I've no doubt he's
<i>awfully</i> ashamed of it now. Perhaps he was never tipsy before.
Perhaps he didn't know there was a lone woman in here to be
frightened."</p>

<p>Just then she heard a gritting sound. She looked down. The
pewter pot was in front of her, and the two-foot rule was slowly
retiring. On the pot was a piece of paper, and on the paper
<span class="nowrap">was&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza ital">
<span class="i0">porter<br /></span>
<span class="i0">good for the helth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">it makes meet<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This time the little seamstress shut her window with a bang
of indignation. The color rose to her pale cheeks. She thought
that she would go down to see the janitor at once. Then she
remembered the seven flights of stairs; and she resolved to see
the janitor in the morning. Then she went to bed, and saw the
mug drawn back just as it had been drawn back the night before.</p>

<p>The morning came, but somehow the seamstress did not care
to complain to the janitor. She hated to make trouble&mdash;and the
janitor might think&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;well, if the wretch did it again
she would speak to him herself, and that would settle it. And
so on the next night, which was a Thursday, the little seamstress
sat down by her window, resolved to settle the matter. And she
had not sat there long, rocking in the creaking little rocking-chair
which she had brought with her from her old home, when the
pewter pot hove in sight, with a piece of paper on the top. This
time the legend read:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza ital">
<span class="i0">Perhaps you are afrade i will<br /></span>
<span class="i0">adress you<br /></span>
<span class="i0">i am not that kind<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The seamstress did not quite know whether to laugh or to
cry. But she felt that the time had come for speech. She leaned
out of her window and addressed the twilight heaven.</p>

<p>"Mr.&mdash;Mr.&mdash;sir&mdash;I&mdash;will you <i>please</i> put your head out of
the window so that I can speak to you?"</p>

<p>The silence of the other room was undisturbed. The seamstress
drew back, blushing. But before she could nerve herself
for another attack, a piece of paper appeared on the end of the
two-foot rule.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2737" name="page2737">2737</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza ital">
<span class="i0">when i Say a thing i<br /></span>
<span class="i0">mene it<br /></span>
<span class="i0">i have Sed i would not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adress you and i<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will not<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>What was the little seamstress to do? She stood by the window
and thought hard about it. Should she complain to the
janitor? But the creature was perfectly respectful. No doubt he
meant to be kind. He certainly was kind, to waste these pots
of porter on her. She remembered the last time&mdash;and the first&mdash;that
she had drunk porter. It was at home, when she was a
young girl, after she had the diphtheria. She remembered how
good it was, and how it had given her back her strength. And
without one thought of what she was doing, she lifted the pot of
porter and took one little reminiscent sip&mdash;two little reminiscent
sips&mdash;and became aware of her utter fall and defeat. She blushed
now as she had never blushed before, put the pot down, closed
the window, and fled to her bed like a deer to the woods.</p>

<p>And when the porter arrived the next night, bearing the simple
<span class="nowrap">appeal&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza ital">
<span class="i0">Dont be afrade of it<br /></span>
<span class="i0">drink it all<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>the little seamstress arose and grasped the pot firmly by the
handle, and poured its contents over the earth around her largest
geranium. She poured the contents out to the last drop, and
then she dropped the pot, and ran back and sat on her bed and
cried, with her face hid in her hands.</p>

<p>"Now," she said to herself, "you've done it! And you're
just as nasty and hard-hearted and suspicious and mean as&mdash;as
pusley!" And she wept to think of her hardness of heart. "He
will never give me a chance to say 'I am sorry,'" she thought.
And really, she might have spoken kindly to the poor man, and
told him that she was much obliged to him, but that he really
must not ask her to drink porter with him.</p>

<p>"But it's all over and done now," she said to herself as she
sat at her window on Saturday night. And then she looked at
the cornice, and saw the faithful little pewter pot traveling
slowly toward her.</p>

<p>She was conquered. This act of Christian forbearance was too
much for her kindly spirit. She read the inscription on the paper,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza ital">
<span class="i0">porter is good for Flours<br /></span>
<span class="i0">but better for Fokes<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page2738" name="page2738">2738</a></span>
and she lifted the pot to her lips, which were not half so red as
her cheeks, and took a good, hearty, grateful draught.</p>

<p>She sipped in thoughtful silence after this first plunge, and
presently she was surprised to find the bottom of the pot in full
view. On the table at her side a few pearl buttons were
screwed up in a bit of white paper. She untwisted the paper
and smoothed it out, and wrote in a tremulous hand&mdash;she <i>could</i>
write a very neat <span class="nowrap">hand&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza ital">
<span class="i0">Thanks.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This she laid on the top of the pot, and in a moment the bent
two-foot rule appeared and drew the mail-carriage home. Then
she sat still, enjoying the warm glow of the porter, which seemed
to have permeated her entire being with a heat that was not at
all like the unpleasant and oppressive heat of the atmosphere, an
atmosphere heavy with the spring damp. A gritting on the tin
aroused her. A piece of paper lay under her eyes.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza ital">
<span class="i0">fine groing weather<br /></span>
<span class="i14">Smith<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Now it is unlikely that in the whole round and range of
conversational commonplaces there was one other greeting that
could have induced the seamstress to continue the exchange of
communications. But this simple and homely phrase touched her
country heart. What did "groing weather" matter to the toilers
in this waste of brick and mortar? This stranger must be, like
herself, a country-bred soul, longing for the new green and the
upturned brown mold of the country fields. She took up the
paper, and wrote under the first message:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza ital">
<span class="i0">Fine<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But that seemed curt: "for&mdash;" she added; "for" what? She did
not know. At last in desperation she put down "potatoes." The
piece of paper was withdrawn, and came back with an addition:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza ital">
<span class="i0">Too mist for potatos<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And when the little seamstress had read this, and grasped the
fact that "m-i-s-t" represented the writer's pronunciation of
"moist," she laughed softly to herself. A man whose mind at
such a time was seriously bent upon potatoes was not a man to
be feared. She found a half-sheet of note-paper, and wrote:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page2739" name="page2739">2739</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p><i>I lived in a small village before I came to New York,
but I am afraid I do not know much about farming. Are
you a farmer?</i></p></blockquote>

<p>The answer came:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza ital">
<span class="i0">have ben most Every thing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">farmed a Spel in Maine<br /></span>
<span class="i14">Smith<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As she read this, the seamstress heard the church clock strike
nine.</p>

<p>"Bless me, is it so late?" she cried, and she hurriedly penciled
<i>Good Night</i>, thrust the paper out, and closed the window.
But a few minutes later, passing by, she saw yet another bit of
paper on the cornice, fluttering in the evening breeze. It said
only <i>good nite</i>, and after a moment's hesitation, the little seamstress
took it in and gave it shelter.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>After this they were the best of friends. Every evening the
pot appeared, and while the seamstress drank from it at her
window, Mr. Smith drank from its twin at his; and notes were
exchanged as rapidly as Mr. Smith's early education permitted.
They told each other their histories, and Mr. Smith's was one of
travel and variety, which he seemed to consider quite a matter
of course. He had followed the sea, he had farmed, he had
been a logger and a hunter in the Maine woods. Now he was
foreman of an East River lumber-yard, and he was prospering.
In a year or two he would have enough laid by to go home to
Bucksport and buy a share in a ship-building business. All this
dribbled out in the course of a jerky but variegated correspondence,
in which autobiographic details were mixed with reflections
moral and philosophical.</p>

<p>A few samples will give an idea of Mr. Smith's style:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza ital">
<span class="i0">i was one trip to van demens<br /></span>
<span class="i0">land<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>To which the seamstress replied:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza ital">
<span class="i0">It must have been very interesting.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But Mr. Smith disposed of this subject very briefly:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza ital">
<span class="i0">it wornt<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page2740" name="page2740">2740</a></span>
Further he vouchsafed:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem ital"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">hong kong could cook flapjacks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">like your mother<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">but my Father was 6 foot 4<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The seamstress had taught school one winter, and she could
not refrain from making an attempt to reform Mr. Smith's orthography.
One evening, in answer to this communication,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza ital">
<span class="i0">i killd a Bare in Maine 600<br /></span>
<span class="i0">lbs waight<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>she wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza ital">
<span class="i0">Isn't it generally spelled Bear?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>but she gave up the attempt when he responded:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza ital">
<span class="i0">a bare is a mene animle any<br /></span>
<span class="i0">way you spel him<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The spring wore on, and the summer came, and still the
evening drink and the evening correspondence brightened the
close of each day for the little seamstress. And the draught of
porter put her to sleep each night, giving her a calmer rest than
she had ever known during her stay in the noisy city; and it
began, moreover, to make a little "meet" for her. And then
the thought that she was going to have an hour of pleasant
companionship somehow gave her courage to cook and eat her
little dinner, however tired she was. The seamstress's cheeks
began to blossom with the June roses.</p>

<p>And all this time Mr. Smith kept his vow of silence unbroken,
though the seamstress sometimes tempted him with little ejaculations
and exclamations to which he might have responded. He
was silent and invisible. Only the smoke of his pipe, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2741" name="page2741">2741</a></span>
clink of his mug as he set it down on the cornice, told her that
a living, material Smith was her correspondent. They never met
on the stairs, for their hours of coming and going did not coincide.
Once or twice they passed each other in the street&mdash;but
Mr. Smith looked straight ahead of him about a foot over her
head. The little seamstress thought he was a very fine-looking
man, with his six feet one and three-quarters and his thick brown
beard. Most people would have called him plain.</p>

<p>Once she spoke to him. She was coming home one summer
evening, and a gang of corner-loafers stopped her and demanded
money to buy beer, as is their custom. Before she had time to
be frightened, Mr. Smith appeared,&mdash;whence, she knew not,&mdash;scattered
the gang like chaff, and collaring two of the human
hyenas, kicked them, with deliberate, ponderous, alternate kicks,
until they writhed in ineffable agony. When he let them crawl
away, she turned to him and thanked him warmly, looking
very pretty now, with the color in her cheeks. But Mr. Smith
answered no word. He stared over her head, grew red in the
face, fidgeted nervously, but held his peace until his eyes fell on
a rotund Teuton passing by.</p>

<p>"Say, Dutchy!" he roared. The German stood aghast. "I
ain't got nothing to write with!" thundered Mr. Smith, looking
him in the eye. And then the man of his word passed on his
way.</p>

<p>And so the summer went on, and the two correspondents
chatted silently from window to window, hid from sight of all
the world below by the friendly cornice. And they looked out
over the roof and saw the green of Tompkins Square grow
darker and dustier as the months went on.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith was given to Sunday trips into the suburbs, and
he never came back without a bunch of daisies or black-eyed
Susans or, later, asters or golden-rod for the little seamstress.
Sometimes, with a sagacity rare in his sex, he brought her a
whole plant, with fresh loam for potting.</p>

<p>He gave her also a reel in a bottle, which, he wrote, he had
"maid" himself, and some coral, and a dried flying-fish that was
something fearful to look upon, with its sword-like fins and its
hollow eyes. At first she could not go to sleep with that flying-fish
hanging on the wall.</p>

<p>But he surprised the little seamstress very much one cool September
evening, when he shoved this letter along the cornice:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page2742" name="page2742">2742</a></span></p>

<div class="figtag">
<a name="Anchor-Smith-Letter" id="Anchor-Smith-Letter"></a>
</div>
<div class="figcenter">
<a title="Go to text" href="#Smith-Letter">
<img src="images/illus-0024-1.png" width="368" height="500" alt="" title="" />
</a>
<p class="center smaller"><a title="Go to text" href="#Smith-Letter">Letter Contents</a></p>
</div>

<p>The little seamstress gazed at this letter a long time. Perhaps
she was wondering in what Ready Letter-Writer of the last
century Mr. Smith had found his form. Perhaps she was amused
at the results of his first attempt at punctuation. Perhaps she
was thinking of something else, for there were tears in her eyes
and a smile on her small mouth.</p>

<p>But it must have been a long time, and Mr. Smith must have
grown nervous, for presently another communication came along
the line where the top of the cornice was worn smooth. It read:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza ital">
<span class="i0">If not understood will you<br /></span>
<span class="i0">mary me<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page2743" name="page2743">2743</a></span>
The little seamstress seized a piece of paper and wrote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza ital">
<span class="i0">If I say Yes, will you speak to me?<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Then she rose and passed it out to him, leaning out of the window,
and their faces met.</p>

<h2><a name="JOHN_BUNYAN" id="JOHN_BUNYAN"></a>JOHN BUNYAN</h2>

<p class="subtitle">(1628-1688)</p>

<p class="subtitle">BY REV. EDWIN P. PARKER</p>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/cap_j.png" title="" alt="J" width="73" height="75" class="cap" />
<p class="cap_2"><span class="dcap">John Bunyan</span>, son of Thomas Bunnionn Jun<sup>r</sup> and Margaret
Bentley, was born 1628, in the quaint old village of Elstow,
one mile southwest of Bedford, near the spot where, three
hundred years before, his ancestor William Boynon resided. His
father was a poor tinker or "braseyer," and his mother's lineage is
unknown. He says,&mdash;"I never went to school to Aristotle or Plato,
but was brought up at my father's house in a very mean condition,
among a company of poor countrymen."</p></div>

<p>He learned to read and write "according to the rate of other poor
men's children"; but soon lost "almost utterly" the little he had
learned. Shortly after his mother's death, when he was about seventeen
years of age, he served as a soldier for several months, probably
in the Parliamentary army. Not long afterward he married a woman
as poor as himself, by whose gentle influence he was gradually led
into the way of those severe spiritual conflicts and "painful exercises
of mind" from which he finally came forth, at great cost, victorious.
These religious experiences, vividly described in his 'Grace Abounding,'
traceable in the course of his chief Pilgrim, and frequently
referred to in his discourses, have been too literally interpreted by
some, and too much explained away as unreal by others; but present
no special difficulty to those who will but consider Bunyan's own
explanations.</p>

<p>From boyhood he had lived a roving and non-religious life,
although possessing no little tenderness of conscience. He was
neither intemperate nor dishonest; he was not a law-breaker; he
explicitly and indignantly declares:&mdash;"If all the fornicators and
adulterers in England were hanged by the neck till they be dead,
John Bunyan would still be alive and well!" The particular sins of
which he was guilty, so far as he specifies them, were profane
swearing, from which he suddenly ceased at a woman's reproof, and
certain sports, innocent enough in themselves, which the prevailing
Puritan rigor severely condemned. What, then, of that vague and
exceeding sinfulness of which he so bitterly accuses and repents
himself? It was that vision of sin, however disproportionate, which
a deeply wounded and graciously healed spirit often has, in looking
back upon the past from that theological standpoint whence all want
of conformity to the perfect law of God seems heinous and dreadful.</p>

<blockquote><p>"A sinner may be comparatively a little sinner, and sensibly a great one.
There are two sorts of greatness in sin: greatness by reason of number;
greatness by reason of the horrible nature of sin. In the last sense, he that
has but one sin, if such an one could be found, may in his own eyes find
himself the biggest sinner in the world."</p>

<p>"Visions of God break the heart, because, by the sight the soul then has
of His perfections, it sees its own infinite and unspeakable disproportion."</p>

<p>"The best saints are most sensible of their sins, and most apt to make
mountains of their molehills."</p></blockquote>

<p>Such sentences from Bunyan's own writings&mdash;and many like them
might be quoted&mdash;shed more light upon the much-debated question
of his "wickedness" than all that his biographers have written.</p>

<p>In John Gifford, pastor of a little Free Church in Bedford, Bunyan
found a wise friend, and in 1653 he joined that church. He soon
discovered his gifts among the brethren, and in due time was appointed
to the office of a gospel minister, in which he labored with
indefatigable industry and zeal, and with ever-increasing fame and
success, until his death. His hard personal fortunes between the
Restoration of 1660 and the Declaration of Indulgence of 1672, including
his imprisonment for twelve years in Bedford Gaol; his subsequent
imprisonment in 1675-6, when the first part of the 'Pilgrim's
Progress' was probably written; and the arduous engagements of his
later and comparatively peaceful years,&mdash;must be sought in biographies,
the latest and perhaps the best of which is that by Rev. John
Brown, minister of the Bunyan Church at Bedford. The statute
under which Bunyan suffered is the 35th Eliz., Cap. 1, re-enacted
with rigor in the 16th Charles II., Cap. 4, 1662; and the spirit of it
appears in the indictment preferred against him:&mdash;"that he hath
devilishly and perniciously abstained from coming to Church to hear
Divine service, and is a common upholder of several unlawful meetings
and conventicles, to the great disturbance and distraction of the
good subjects of this Kingdom," etc., etc.</p>

<p>The story of Bunyan's life up to the time of his imprisonment,
and particularly that of his arrests and examinations before the justices,
and also the account of his experiences in prison, should be
read in his own most graphic narrative, in the 'Grace Abounding,'
which is one of the most precious portions of all autobiographic
literature. Bunyan was born and bred, he lived and labored, among
the common people, with whom his sympathies were strong and tender,
and by whom he was regarded with the utmost veneration and
affection. He understood them, and they him. For nearly a century
they were almost the only readers of his published writings. They
came to call him Bishop Bunyan. His native genius, his great
human-heartedness and loving-kindness, his burning zeal and indomitable
courage, his racy humor and kindling imagination, all vitalized<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2749" name="page2749">2749</a></span>
by the spiritual force which came upon him through the encompassing
atmosphere of devout Puritanism, were consecrated to the welfare
of his fellow-men. His personal friend, Mr. Doe, describes him as
"tall in stature, strong-boned, of a ruddy face, with sparkling eyes,
nose well set, mouth moderately large, forehead something high,
and his habit always plain and modest." His portrait, painted in
1685, shows a vigorous, kindly face, with mustachios and imperial,
and abundance of hair falling in long wavy masses about the neck
and shoulders,&mdash;more Cavalier-like than Roundhead.</p>

<p class="caption">JOHN BUNYAN.</p>
</div>

<p>Bunyan was a voluminous writer, and his works, many of them
posthumous, are said to equal in number the sixty years of his life.
But even the devout and sympathetic critic is compelled to acknowledge
the justice of that verdict of time which has consigned most of
them to a virtual oblivion. The controversial tracts possess no elements
of enduring interest. The doctrinal and spiritual discourses are
elaborations of a system of religious thought which long ago "had
its day and ceased to be." Yet they contain pithy sentences, homely
and pat illustrations, and many a paragraph, rugged or tender, in
which one recognizes the stamp of his genius, and an intimation of
his remarkable power as a preacher. The best of these discourses,
'The Jerusalem Sinner Saved,' 'Come and Welcome to Jesus Christ,'
and 'Light for Them that Sit in Darkness,' while they sparkle here
and there with things unique and precious to the Bunyan-curious
student, would seem dull and tedious to the general though devout
reader. In many a passage we feel, to use his phrase, his "heart-pulling
power," no less than the force and felicity of his most
original images and analogies; but these passages are little oases in
a dry and thirsty land. The 'Life and Death of Mr. Badman' vividly
presents certain aspects of English provincial life in that day;
but they are repulsive, and the entire work is marred by flat moralizings
and coarse, often incredible stories.</p>

<p>The 'Holy War,' which Macaulay said would have been our greatest
religious allegory if the 'Pilgrim's Progress' had not been written,
has ceased to be much read. The conception of the conquest of
the human soul by the irresistible operation of divine force is so foreign
to modern thought and faith that Bunyan's similitude no longer
seems a verisimilitude. The pages abound with quaint, humorous,
and lifelike touches;&mdash;as where Diabolus stations at Ear-Gate a
guard of deaf men under old Mr. Prejudice, and Unbelief is described
as "a nimble jack whom they could never lay hold of";&mdash;but as
compared with the 'Pilgrim's Progress' the allegory is artificial, its
elaboration of analogies is ponderous and tedious, and its characters
lack solidity and reality.</p>

<p>All these works, however, exhibit a remarkable command of the
mother tongue, a shrewd common-sense and mother wit, a fervid<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2750" name="page2750">2750</a></span>
spiritual life, and a wonderful knowledge of the English Bible. They
may be likened to more or less submerged wrecks kept from sinking
into utter neglect by the bond of authorship which connects them
with the one incomparable work which floats, unimpaired by time,
on the sea of universal appreciation and favor. Bunyan's unique and
secure position in English literature was gained by the 'Pilgrim's
Progress,' the first part of which was published in 1678, and the
second in 1685.</p>

<p>The broader, freer conception of the pilgrimage&mdash;as old in literature
as the ninetieth Psalm, apt and fond, as innumerable books
show, from De Guileville's 'Le Pelerinage de l'Homme' in the fourteenth
century to Patrick's 'Parable' three hundred years later&mdash;took
sudden possession of Bunyan's imagination while he was in
prison, and kindled all his finest powers. Then he undertook, poet-wise,
to work out this conception, capable of such diversity of illustration,
in a form of literature that has ever been especially congenial
to the human mind. Unguided save by his own consecrated genius,
unaided by other books than his English Bible and Fox's 'Book of
Martyrs,' he proceeded with a simplicity of purpose and felicity of
expression, and with a fidelity to nature and life, which gave to his
unconsciously artistic story the charm of perfect artlessness as well
as the semblance of reality. When Bunyan's lack of learning and
culture are considered, and also the comparative dryness of his controversial
and didactic writings, this efflorescence of a vital spirit of
beauty and of an essentially poetic genius in him seems quite inexplicable.
The author's rhymed 'Apology for His Book,' which
usually prefaces the 'Pilgrim's Progress,' contains many significant
hints as to the way in which he was led to</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Make truth spangle, and its rays to shine."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He had no thought of producing a work of literary excellence; but
on the other hand he had not, in writing this book, his customary
purpose of spiritual edification. Indeed, he put his multiplying
thoughts and fancies aside, lest they should interfere with a more
<i>serious</i> and <i>important</i> book which he had in hand!</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">"I only thought to make<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I knew not what: nor did I undertake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thereby to please my neighbor; no, not I:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I did it mine own self to gratify.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i2 dotwide">. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thus I set pen to paper with delight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And quickly had my thoughts in black and white."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page2751" name="page2751">2751</a></span>
The words are exceedingly suggestive. In writing so aimlessly&mdash;"I
knew not what"&mdash;to gratify himself by permitting the allegory
into which he had suddenly fallen to take possession of him and
carry him whithersoever it would, while he wrote out with delight
his teeming fancies, was not Bunyan for the first time exercising his
genius in a freedom from all theological and other restraint, and so
in a surpassing range and power? The dreamer and poet supplanted
the preacher and teacher. He yielded to the simple impulse of his
genius, gave his imagination full sweep, and so, as never before or
elsewhere, soared and sang in what seemed to many of his Puritan
friends a questionable freedom and profane inspiration. And yet his
song, or story, was not a creation of mere fancy,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"It came from my own heart, so to my head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thence into my fingers tricklÃ¨d;"&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and therefore, we add, it finds its way to the heart of mankind.</p>

<p>Hence the spontaneity of the allegory, its ease and freedom of
movement, its unlabored development, its natural and vital enfolding
of that old pilgrim idea of human life which had so often bloomed
in the literature of all climes and ages, but whose consummate
flower appeared in the book of this inspired Puritan tinker-preacher.
Hence also the dramatic unity and methodic perfectness of the story.
Its byways all lead to its highway; its episodes are as vitally related
to the main theme as are the ramifications of a tree to its central
stem. The great diversities of experience in the true pilgrims are
dominated by one supreme motive. As for the others, they
appear incidentally to complete the scenes, and make the world and
its life manifold and real. The Pilgrim is a most substantial person,
and once well on the way, the characters he meets, the difficulties
he encounters, the succor he receives, the scenes in which he
mingles, are all, however surprising, most natural. The names, and
one might almost say the forms and faces, of Pliable, Obstinate,
Faithful, Hopeful, Talkative, Mercy, Great-heart, old Honest, Valiant-for-truth,
Feeble-mind, Ready-to-halt, Miss Much-afraid, and many
another, are familiar to us all. Indeed, the pilgrimage is our own&mdash;in
many of its phases at least,&mdash;and we have met the people
whom Bunyan saw in his dream, and are ourselves they whom he
describes. When Dean Stanley began his course of lectures on
Ecclesiastical History at Oxford, his opening words were those of
the passage where the Pilgrim is taken to the House Beautiful to
see "the rarities and histories of that place, both ancient and
modern"; and at the end of the same course, wishing to sketch the
prospects of Christendom, he quoted the words in which, on leaving
the House Beautiful, Christian was shown the distant view of the
Delectable Mountains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page2752" name="page2752">2752</a></span>
But for one glance at Pope and Pagan, there is almost nothing to
indicate the writer's ecclesiastical standing. But for here and there
a marking of time in prosaic passages which have nothing to do
with the story, there is nothing to mar the catholicity of its spirit.
Romanists and Protestants, Anglicans and Puritans, Calvinists and
Arminians,&mdash;all communions and sects have edited and circulated it.
It is the completest triumph of truth by fiction in all literature.
More than any other human book, it is "a religious bond to the whole
of English Christendom." The second part is perhaps inferior to the
first, but is richer in incident, and some of its characters&mdash;Mercy,
old Honest, Valiant-for-truth, and Great-heart, for instance&mdash;are
exquisitely conceived and presented. Here again the reader will do
well to carefully peruse the author's rhymed introduction:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"What Christian left locked up, and went his way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet Christiana opens with her key."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Go then, my little Book," he says, "and tell young damsels of
Mercy, and old men of plain-hearted old Honest. Tell people of
Master Fearing, who was a good man, though much down in spirit.
Tell them of Feeble-mind, and Ready-to-halt, and Master Despondency
and his daughter, who 'softly went but sure.'</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"When thou hast told the world of all these things,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then turn about, my Book, and touch these strings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which, if but touched, will such a music make,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They'll make a cripple dance, a giant quake."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This second part introduces some new scenes, as well as characters
and experiences, but with the same broad sympathy and
humor; and there are closing descriptions not excelled in power and
pathos by anything in the earlier pilgrimage.</p>

<p>In his 'Apology' Bunyan says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"This book is writ in such a dialect<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As may the minds of listless men affect."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The idiom of the book is purely English, acquired by a diligent
study of the English Bible. It is the simplest, raciest, and most
sinewy English to be found in any writer of our language; and Bunyan's
amazing use of this Saxon idiom for all the purposes of his
story, and the range and freedom of his imaginative genius therein,
like certain of Tennyson's 'Idylls,' show it to be an instrument of
symphonic capacity and variety. Bunyan's own maxim is a good
one:&mdash;"Words easy to be understood do often hit the mark, when
high and learned ones do only pierce the air."</p>

<p>Of the 'Pilgrim's Progress,' in both its parts, we may say in the
words of Milton:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page2753" name="page2753">2753</a></span></p>
<blockquote><p>"These are works that could not be composed by the invocation of Dame
Memory and her siren daughters, but by devout prayer to that eternal Spirit
who can enrich with all utterance and knowledge, and send out his Seraphim,
with the hallowed fire of his altar, to touch and purify the lips of whom he
pleases, without reference to station, birth, or education."</p></blockquote>

<p>Let Bunyan speak for his own book:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Wouldst thou be in a dream, and yet not sleep?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or wouldst thou in a moment laugh and weep?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wouldst thou lose thyself and catch no harm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And find thyself again, without a charm?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wouldst read thyself, and read, thou knowst not what,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet know whether thou art blest or not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By reading the same lines? O then come hither!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lay my book, thy head, and heart together."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Bunyan died of fever, in the house of a friend, at London, August
12th, 1688, in the sixty-first year of his age. Three of his four
children survived him; the blind daughter, for whom he expressed
such affectionate solicitude during his imprisonment, died before him.
His second wife, Elisabeth, who pleaded for him with so much
dignity and feeling before Judge Hale and other justices, died in
1692. In 1661 a recumbent statue was placed on his tomb in Bunhill
Fields, and thirteen years later a noble statue was erected in his
honor at Bedford. The church at Elstow is enriched with memorial
windows presenting scenes from the 'Holy War' and the 'Pilgrim's
Progress,' and the Bunyan Meeting-House in Bedford has bronze
doors presenting similar scenes.</p>

<p>The great allegory has been translated into almost every language
and dialect under the sun. The successive editions of it are
almost innumerable; and no other book save the Bible has had an
equally large circulation. The verdict of approval stamped upon
it at first by the common people, has been fully recognized and
accepted by the learned and cultivated.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_FIGHT_WITH_APOLLYON" id="THE_FIGHT_WITH_APOLLYON"></a>THE FIGHT WITH APOLLYON</h3>

<p class="subtitle">From the 'Pilgrim's Progress'</p>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="dcap">But</span> now, in this Valley of Humiliation, poor Christian was
hard put to it; for he had gone but a little way before
he espied a foul fiend coming over the field to meet him;
his name is Apollyon. Then did Christian begin to be afraid,
and to cast in his mind whether to go back or to stand his
ground: But he considered again that he had no armor for his
back, and therefore thought that to turn the back to him might
give him the greater advantage with ease to pierce him with his
darts. Therefore he resolved to venture and stand his ground;
for, thought he, had I no more in mine eye than the saving of
my life, 'twould be the best way to stand.</p>

<p>So he went on, and Apollyon met him. Now the monster
was hideous to behold: he was clothed with scales like a fish
(and they are his pride); he had wings like a dragon, feet like a
bear, and out of his belly came fire and smoke; and his mouth
was as the mouth of a lion. When he was come up to Christian,
he beheld him with a disdainful countenance, and thus began to
question with him.</p>

<div class="drama">
<p><span class="speaker"><i>Apollyon</i></span>&mdash;Whence come you? and whither are you bound?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><i>Christian</i></span>&mdash;I am come from the City of Destruction, which is
the place of all evil, and am going to the City of Zion.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><i>Apollyon</i></span>&mdash;By this I perceive thou art one of my subjects, for
all that country is mine, and I am the prince and god of it.
How is it then that thou hast run away from thy King? Were
it not that I hope thou mayest do me more service, I would
strike thee now at one blow to the ground.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><i>Christian</i></span>&mdash;I was born indeed in your dominions, but your
service was hard, and your wages such as a man could not live
on, "for the wages of sin is death;" therefore when I was come
to years, I did as other considerate persons do&mdash;look out, if perhaps
I might mend myself.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><i>Apollyon</i></span>&mdash;There is no prince that will thus lightly lose his
subjects, neither will I as yet lose thee; but since thou complainest
of thy service and wages, be content to go back; what our
country will afford, I do here promise to give thee.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><i>Christian</i></span>&mdash;But I have let myself to another, even to the King
of Princes, and how can I with fairness go back with thee?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page2755" name="page2755">2755</a></span>
<span class="speaker"><i>Apollyon</i></span>&mdash;Thou hast done in this according to the proverb,
changed a bad for a worse; but it is ordinary for those that have
professed themselves his servants, after a while to give him the
slip and return again to me: Do thou so too, and all shall be well.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><i>Christian</i></span>&mdash;I have given him my faith, and sworn my allegiance
to him: how then can I go back from this, and not be
hanged as a traitor?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><i>Apollyon</i></span>&mdash;Thou didst the same to me, and yet I am willing
to pass by all, if now thou wilt yet turn again and go back.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><i>Christian</i></span>&mdash;What I promised thee was in my nonage; and
besides, I count that the Prince under whose banner now I stand
is able to absolve me; yea, and to pardon also what I did as
to my compliance with thee: and besides, O thou destroying
Apollyon, to speak truth, I like his service, his wages, his servants,
his government, his company and country, better than
thine; and therefore leave off to persuade me further; I am his
servant, and I will follow him.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><i>Apollyon</i></span>&mdash;Consider again when thou art in cool blood, what
thou art like to meet with in the way that thou goest. Thou
knowest that for the most part his servants come to an ill end,
because they are transgressors against me and my ways: How
many of them have been put to shameful deaths; and besides,
thou countest his service better than mine, whereas he never
came yet from the place where he is to deliver any that served
him out of our hands; but as for me, how many times, as all
the world very well knows, have I delivered, either by power or
fraud, those that have faithfully served me, from him and his,
though taken by them; and so I will deliver thee.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><i>Christian</i></span>&mdash;His forbearing at present to deliver them is on
purpose to try their love, whether they will cleave to him to the
end: and as for the ill end thou sayest they come to, that is
most glorious in their account; <ins class="correction" title="Added comma">for,</ins> for present deliverance, they
do not much expect it, for they stay for their glory, and then
they shall have it, when their Prince comes in his, and the glory
of the angels.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><i>Apollyon</i></span>&mdash;Thou hast already been unfaithful in thy service to
him, and how dost thou think to receive wages of him?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><i>Christian</i></span>&mdash;Wherein, O Apollyon, have I been unfaithful to
him?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><i>Apollyon</i></span>&mdash;Thou didst faint at first setting out, when thou
wast almost choked in the Gulf of Despond; thou didst attempt<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2756" name="page2756">2756</a></span>
wrong ways to be rid of thy burden, whereas thou shouldst have
stayed till thy Prince had taken it off; thou didst sinfully sleep
and lose thy choice thing; thou wast also almost persuaded to
go back at the sight of the lions; and when thou talkest of
thy journey, and of what thou hast heard and seen, thou art
inwardly desirous of vainglory in all that thou sayest or doest.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><i>Christian</i></span>&mdash;All this is true, and much more which thou hast
left out; but the Prince whom I serve and honor is merciful,
and ready to forgive; but besides, these infirmities possessed me
in thy country, for there I sucked them in, and I have groaned
under them, been sorry for them, and have obtained pardon of
my Prince.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><i>Apollyon</i></span>&mdash;Then Apollyon broke out into grievous rage, saying,
I am an enemy to this Prince; I hate his person, his laws
and people: I am come out on purpose to withstand thee.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><i>Christian</i></span>&mdash;Apollyon, beware what you do, for I am in the
King's highway, the way of holiness, therefore take heed to
yourself.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><i>Apollyon</i></span>&mdash;Then Apollyon straddled quite over the whole
breadth of the way, and said, I am void of fear in this matter;
prepare thyself to die; for I swear by my infernal den, that
thou shalt go no further; here will I spill thy soul.</p>
</div>

<p>And with that he threw a flaming dart at his breast, but
Christian had a shield in his hand, with which he caught it, and
so prevented the danger of that.</p>

<p>Then did Christian draw, for he saw 'twas time to bestir him:
and Apollyon as fast made at him, throwing darts as thick as
hail; by the which, notwithstanding all that Christian could do
to avoid it, Apollyon wounded him in his head, his hand, and
foot. This made Christian give a little back; Apollyon therefore
followed his work amain, and Christian again took courage, and
resisted as manfully as he could. This sore combat lasted for
above half a day, even till Christian was almost quite spent; for
you must know that Christian, by reason of his wounds, must
needs grow weaker and weaker.</p>

<p>Then Apollyon, espying his opportunity, began to gather up
close to Christian, and wrestling with him, gave him a dreadful
fall; and with that Christian's sword flew out of his hand. Then
said Apollyon, I am sure of thee now; and with that he had
almost pressed him to death, so that Christian began to despair
of life: but as God would have it, while Apollyon was fetching<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2757" name="page2757">2757</a></span>
of his last blow, thereby to make a full end of this good man,
Christian nimbly stretched out his hand for his sword, and
caught it, saying, "Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy!
when I fall I shall arise;" and with that gave him a deadly
thrust, which made him give back, as one that had received his
mortal wound; Christian, perceiving that, made at him again,
saying, "Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors
through him that loved us." And with that Apollyon spread
forth his dragon's wings, and sped him away, that Christian for
a season saw him no more.</p>

<p>In this combat no man can imagine, unless he had seen and
heard as I did, what yelling and hideous roaring Apollyon made
all the time of the fight; he spake like a dragon; and on the
other side, what sighs and groans burst from Christian's heart. I
never saw him all the while give so much as one pleasant look,
till he perceived he had wounded Apollyon with his two-edged
sword; then indeed he did smile, and look upward; but 'twas the
dreadfulest sight that ever I saw.</p>

<p>So when the battle was over, Christian said, I will here give
thanks to him that hath delivered me out of the mouth of the
lion, to him that did help me against Apollyon. And so he did,
saying:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Great Beelzebub, the captain of this fiend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Designed my ruin; therefore to this end<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sent him harnessed out: and he with rage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That hellish was, did fiercely me engage:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But blessed Michael helpÃ¨d me, and I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By dint of sword did quickly make him fly.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therefore to him let me give lasting praise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thank and bless his holy name always.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Then there came to him a hand, with some of the leaves of
the tree of life, the which Christian took, and applied to the
wounds that he had received in the battle, and was healed immediately.
He also sat down in that place to eat bread, and to
drink of the bottle that was given him a little before; so being
refreshed, he addressed himself to his journey, with his sword
drawn in his hand; for he said, I know not but some other enemy
may be at hand. But he met with no other affront from Apollyon
quite through this valley.</p>

<p class="subtitle">From the 'Pilgrim's Progress'</p>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="dcap">They</span> went then till they came to the Delectable Mountains,
which mountains belong to the Lord of that Hill of which
we have spoken before; so they went up to the mountains,
to behold the gardens and orchards, the vineyards and fountains
of water; where also they drank, and washed themselves, and
did freely eat of the vineyards. Now there were on the tops of
these mountains shepherds feeding their flocks, and they stood
by the highway side. The pilgrims therefore went to them, and
leaning upon their staves (as is common with weary pilgrims,
when they stand to talk with any by the way) they asked,
Whose delectable mountains are these? And whose be the sheep
that feed upon them?</p>

<div class="drama">
<p><span class="speaker"><i>Shepherds</i></span>&mdash;These mountains are "Immanuel's Land," and they
are within sight of his city; and the sheep also are his, and he
laid down his life for them.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><i>Christian</i></span>&mdash;Is this the way to the Celestial City?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><i>Shepherds</i></span>&mdash;You are just in your way.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><i>Christian</i></span>&mdash;How far is it thither?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><i>Shepherds</i></span>&mdash;Too far for any but those that shall get thither
indeed.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><i>Christian</i></span>&mdash;Is the way safe or dangerous?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><i>Shepherds</i></span>&mdash;Safe for those for whom it is to be safe, "but
transgressors shall fall therein."</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><i>Christian</i></span>&mdash;Is there in this place any relief for pilgrims that
are weary and faint in the way?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><i>Shepherds</i></span>&mdash;The lord of these mountains hath given us a
charge "not to be forgetful to entertain strangers"; therefore the
good of the place is before you.</p>
</div>

<p>I saw also in my dream, that when the shepherds perceived
that they were wayfaring men, they also put questions to them
(to which they made answer as in other places), as, Whence came
you? and, How got you into the way? and, By what means have
you so persevered therein? For but few of them that begin to
come hither do show their face on these mountains. But when
the shepherds heard their answers, being pleased therewith, they
looked very lovingly upon them, and said, Welcome to the Delectable
Mountains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page2759" name="page2759">2759</a></span>
The shepherds, I say, whose names were Knowledge, Experience,
Watchful, and Sincere, took them by the hand, and had
them to their tents, and made them partake of that which was
ready at present. They said moreover, We would that ye should
stay here a while, to be acquainted with us; and yet more to
solace yourselves with the good of these delectable mountains.
They then told them that they were content to stay; and so
they went to their rest that night, because it was very late.</p>

<p>Then I saw in my dream, that in the morning the shepherds
called up Christian and Hopeful to walk with them upon the
mountains; so they went forth with them, and walked a while,
having a pleasant prospect on every side. Then said the shepherds
one to another, Shall we show these pilgrims some wonders?
So when they had concluded to do it, they had them first
to the top of a hill called Error, which was very steep on the
furthest side, and bid them look down to the bottom. So Christian
and Hopeful looked down, and saw at the bottom several
men dashed all to pieces by a fall that they had from the top.
Then said Christian, What meaneth this? The shepherds answered,
Have you not heard of them that were made to err, by
hearkening to Hymeneus and Philetus, as concerning the faith of
the resurrection of the body? They answered, Yes. Then said
the shepherds, Those that you see lie dashed in pieces at the
bottom of this mountain are they; and they have continued to
this day unburied (as you see) for an example to others to take
heed how they clamber too high, or how they come too near the
brink of this mountain.</p>

<p>Then I saw that they had them to the top of another mountain,
and the name of that is Caution, and bid them look afar
off; which when they did, they perceived, as they thought, several
men walking up and down among the tombs that were
there; and they perceived that the men were blind, because they
stumbled sometimes upon the tombs, and because they could not
get out from among them. Then said Christian, What means
this?</p>

<p>The shepherds then answered, Did you not see a little below
these mountains a stile, that led into a meadow, on the left hand
of this way? They answered, Yes. Then said the shepherds,
From that stile there goes a path that leads directly to Doubting
Castle, which is kept by Giant Despair; and these men (pointing
to them among the tombs) came once on pilgrimages as you do<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2760" name="page2760">2760</a></span>
now, even till they came to that same stile; and because the
right way was rough in that place, and they chose to go out of
it into that meadow, and there were taken by Giant Despair and
cast into Doubting Castle; where, after they had been awhile
kept in the dungeon, he at last did put out their eyes, and led
them among those tombs, where he has left them to wander to
this very day, that the saying of the wise man might be fulfilled,
"He that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall
remain in the congregation of the dead." Then Christian and
Hopeful looked upon one another, with tears gushing out, but
yet said nothing to the shepherds.</p>

<p>Then I saw in my dream that the shepherds had them to
another place, in a bottom, where was a door in the side of a
hill, and they opened the door, and bid them look in. They
looked in therefore, and saw that within it was very dark and
smoky; they also thought that they heard there a rumbling
noise as of fire, and a cry as of some tormented, and that they
smelt the scent of brimstone. Then said Christian, What means
this?</p>

<p>The shepherds told them, This is a by-way to hell, a way
that hypocrites go in at; namely, such as sell their <ins class="correction" title="Standardized from 'birth-right'">birthright</ins>,
with Esau; such as sell their Master, as Judas; such as blaspheme
the Gospel, with Alexander; and that lie and dissemble,
with Ananias and Sapphira his wife. Then said Hopeful to the
shepherds, I perceive that these had on them, even every one, a
show of pilgrimage, as we have now: had they not?</p>

<div class="drama">
<p><span class="speaker"><i>Shepherds</i></span>&mdash;Yes, and held it a long time too.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><i>Hopeful</i></span>&mdash;How far might they go on in pilgrimage in their
day, since they notwithstanding were thus miserably cast away?</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><i>Shepherds</i></span>&mdash;Some further, and some not so far as these mountains.</p>

<p>Then said the pilgrims one to another, We had need to cry to
the Strong for strength.</p>

<p><span class="speaker"><i>Shepherds</i></span>&mdash;Ay, and you will have need to use it when you
have it too.</p>
</div>

<p>By this time the pilgrims had a desire to go forwards, and
the shepherds a desire they should; so they walked together
towards the end of the mountains. Then said the shepherds one
to another, Let us here show to the pilgrims the gates of the
Celestial City, if they have skill to look through our perspective-glass.
The pilgrims then lovingly accepted the motion; so they<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2761" name="page2761">2761</a></span>
had them to the top of a high hill, called Clear, and gave them
their glass to look.</p>

<p>Then they essayed to look, but the remembrance of that last
thing that the shepherds had showed them made their hands
shake, by means of which impediment they could not look
steadily through the glass; yet they thought they saw something
like the gate, and also some of the glory of the place.</p>

<h3><a name="CHRISTIANA_AND_HER_COMPANIONS_ENTER_THE_CELESTIAL" id="CHRISTIANA_AND_HER_COMPANIONS_ENTER_THE_CELESTIAL"></a>CHRISTIANA AND HER COMPANIONS ENTER THE CELESTIAL
CITY</h3>

<p class="subtitle">From the 'Pilgrim's Progress'</p>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="dcap">Now</span> while they lay here and waited for the good hour, there
was a noise in the town that there was a post come from
the Celestial City, with matter of great importance to one
Christiana, the wife of Christian the pilgrim. So inquiry was
made for her, and the house was found out where she was. So
the post presented her with a letter, the contents whereof was,
Hail, good woman, I bring thee tidings that the Master calleth
for thee, and expecteth that thou shouldest stand in his presence
in clothes of immortality, within this ten days.</p>

<p>When he had read this letter to her, he gave her therewith
a sure token that he was a true messenger, and was come to
bid her make haste to be gone. The token was an arrow with
a point sharpened with love, let easily into her heart, which
by degrees wrought so effectually with her, that at the time
appointed she must be gone.</p>

<p>When Christiana saw that her time was come, and that she was
the first of this company that was to go over, she called for Mr.
Great-heart her guide, and told him how matters were. So he
told her he was heartily glad of the news, and could have been
glad had the post come for him. Then she bid that he should
give advice how all things should be prepared for her journey.
So he told her, saying, Thus and thus it must be, and we that
survive will accompany you to the river-side.</p>

<p>Then she called for her children and gave them her blessing,
and told them that she yet read with comfort the mark that was
set in their foreheads, and was glad to see them with her there,
and that they had kept their garments so white. Lastly, she
bequeathed to the poor that little she had, and commanded her<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2762" name="page2762">2762</a></span>
sons and daughters to be ready against the messenger should
come for them.</p>

<p>When she had spoken these words to her guide and to her
children, she called for Mr. Valiant-for-truth, and said unto him,
Sir, you have in all places showed yourself true-hearted; be faithful
unto death, and my King will give you a crown of life. I
would also entreat you to have an eye to my children, and if at
any time you see them faint, speak comfortably to them. For
my daughters, my sons' wives, they have been faithful, and a fulfilling
of the promise upon them will be their end. But she gave
Mr. Stand-fast a ring.</p>

<p>Then she called for old Mr. Honest and said of him, Behold
an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile. Then said he, I
wish you a fair day when you set out for Mount Sion, and
shall be glad to see that you go over the river dry-shod. But
she answered, Come wet, come dry, I long to be gone, for however
the weather is in my journey, I shall have time enough
when I come there to sit down and rest me and dry me.</p>

<p>Then came in that good man Mr. Ready-to-halt, to see her.
So she said to him, Thy travel hither has been with difficulty,
but that will make thy rest the sweeter. But watch and be
ready, for at an hour when you think not, the messenger may
come.</p>

<p>After him came in Mr. Despondency and his daughter Much-afraid,
to whom she said, You ought with thankfulness forever to
remember your deliverance from the hands of Giant Despair and
out of Doubting Castle. The effect of that mercy is, that you
are brought with safety hither. Be ye watchful and cast away
fear, be sober and hope to the end.</p>

<p>Then she said to Mr. Feeble-mind, Thou wast delivered from
the mouth of Giant Slay-good, that thou mightest live in the
light of the living for ever, and see thy King with comfort.
Only I advise thee to repent thee of thine aptness to fear and
doubt of his goodness before he sends for thee, lest thou shouldest,
when he comes, be forced to stand before him for that fault
with blushing.</p>

<p>Now the day drew on that Christiana must be gone. So the
road was full of people to see her take her journey. But behold,
all the banks beyond the river were full of horses and chariots,
which were come down from above to accompany her to the city
gate. So she came forth and entered the river with a beckon of<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2763" name="page2763">2763</a></span>
farewell to those who followed her to the river-side. The last
words she was heard to say here was, I come, Lord, to be with
thee and bless thee.</p>

<p>So her children and friends returned to their place, for that
those that waited for Christiana had carried her out of their
sight. So she went and called and entered in at the gate with
all the ceremonies of joy that her husband Christian had done
before her. At her departure her children wept, but Mr. Great-heart
and Mr. Valiant played upon the well-tuned cymbal and
harp for joy. So all departed to their respective places.</p>

<p>In process of time there came a post to the town again, and
his business was with Mr. Ready-to-halt. So he inquired him
out, and said to him, I am come to thee in the name of Him
whom thou hast loved and followed, though upon crutches; and
my message is to tell thee that he expects thee at his table to
sup with him in his kingdom the next day after Easter, wherefore
prepare thyself for this journey.</p>

<p>Then he also gave him a token that he was a true messenger,
saying, "I have broken thy golden bowl, and loosed thy silver
cord."</p>

<p>After this Mr. Ready-to-halt called for his fellow pilgrims,
and told them saying, I am sent for, and God shall surely visit
you also. So he desired Mr. Valiant to make his will. And
because he had nothing to bequeath to them that should survive
him but his crutches and his good wishes, therefore thus he said,
These crutches I bequeath to my son that shall tread in my
steps, with a hundred warm wishes that he may prove better
than I have done.</p>

<p>Then he thanked Mr. Great-heart for his conduct and kindness,
and so addressed himself to his journey. When he came
at the brink of the river he said, Now I shall have no more need
of these crutches, since yonder are chariots and horses for me to
ride on. The last words he was heard to say were, Welcome, life.
So he went his way.</p>

<p>After this Mr. Feeble-mind had tidings brought him that the
post sounded his horn at his chamber door. Then he came in
and told him, saying, I am come to tell thee that thy Master
has need of thee, and that in very little time thou must behold
his face in brightness. And take this as a token of the truth of
my message, "Those that look out at the windows shall be
darkened."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page2764" name="page2764">2764</a></span>
Then Mr. Feeble-mind called for his friends, and told them
what errand had been brought unto him, and what token he had
received of the truth of the message. Then he said, Since I
have nothing to bequeath to any, to what purpose should I make
a will? As for my feeble mind, that I will leave behind me, for
that I have no need of that in the place whither I go. Nor is
it worth bestowing upon the poorest pilgrim; wherefore when I
am gone, I desire that you, Mr. Valiant, would bury it in a
dung-hill. This done, and the day being come in which he was
to depart, he entered the river as the rest. His last words were,
Hold out faith and patience. So he went over to the other side.</p>

<p>When days had many of them passed away, Mr. Despondency
was sent for. For a post was come, and brought this message
to him, Trembling man, these are to summon thee to be ready
with thy King by the next Lord's day, to shout for joy for thy
deliverance from all thy doubtings.</p>

<p>And said the messenger, That my message is true, take this
for a proof; so he gave him "The grasshopper to be a burden
unto him." Now Mr. Despondency's daughter, whose name
was Much-afraid, said when she heard what was done, that she
would go with her father. Then Mr. Despondency said to his
friends, Myself and my daughter, you know what we have been,
and how troublesomely we have behaved ourselves in every company.
My will and my daughter's is, that our desponds and
slavish fears be by no man ever received from the day of our
departure for ever, for I know that after my death they will
offer themselves to others. For to be plain with you, they are
ghosts, the which we entertained when we first began to be
pilgrims, and could never shake them off after; and they will
walk about and seek entertainment of the pilgrims, but for our
sakes shut ye the doors upon them.</p>

<p>When the time was come for them to depart, they went to
the brink of the river. The last words of Mr. Despondency
were, Farewell, night; welcome, day. His daughter went through
the river singing, but none could understand what she said.</p>

<p>Then it came to pass a while after, that there was a post in
the town that inquired for Mr. Honest.... When the day
that he was to be gone was come, he addressed himself to go
over the river. Now the river at that time overflowed the banks
in some places, but Mr. Honest in his lifetime had spoken to one
Good-conscience to meet him there, the which he also did, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2765" name="page2765">2765</a></span>
lent him his hand, and so helped him over. The last words of
Mr. Honest were, Grace reigns. So he left the world.</p>

<p>After this it was noised abroad that Mr. Valiant-for-truth was
taken with a summons by the same post as the other, and had
this for a token that the summons was true, "That his pitcher
was broken at the fountain." When he understood it, he called
for his friends, and told them of it. Then said he, I am going
to my fathers, and though with great difficulty I am got hither,
yet now I do not repent me of all the trouble I have been at to
arrive where I am. My sword I give to him that shall succeed
me in my pilgrimage, and my courage and skill to him that can
get it. My marks and scars I carry with me, to be a witness for
me that I have fought his battles who now will be my rewarder.
When the day that he must go hence was come, many accompanied
him to the river-side, into which as he went he said,
Death, where is thy sting? And as he went down deeper he
said, Grave, where is thy victory? So he passed over, and all
the trumpets sounded for him on the other side.</p>

<p>Then there came forth a summons for Mr. Stand-fast (this Mr.
Stand-fast was he that the rest of the pilgrims found upon his
knees in the enchanted ground), for the post brought it him open
in his hands. The contents whereof were, that he must prepare
for a change of life, for his Master was not willing that he
should be so far from him any longer. At this Mr. Stand-fast
was put into a muse. Nay, said the messenger, you need not
doubt of the truth of my message, for here is a token of the
truth thereof, "Thy wheel is broken at the cistern." Then he
called to him Mr. Great-heart, who was their guide, and said unto
him, Sir, although it was not my hap to be much in your good
company in the days of my pilgrimage, yet since the time I
knew you, you have been profitable to me. When I came from
home, I left behind me a wife and five small children: let me
entreat you at your return (for I know that you will go and
return to your Master's house, in hopes that you may yet be a
conductor to more of the holy pilgrims) that you send to my
family, and let them be acquainted with all that hath and shall
happen unto me. Tell them moreover of my happy arrival to
this place, and of the present late blessed condition that I am in.
Tell them also of Christian and Christiana his wife, and how she
and her children came after her husband. Tell them also of
what a happy end she made, and whither she is gone. I have<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2766" name="page2766">2766</a></span>
little or nothing to send to my family, except it be prayers and
tears for them; of which it will suffice if thou acquaint them, if
peradventure they may prevail.</p>

<p>When Mr. Stand-fast had thus set things in order, and the
time being come for him to haste him away, he also went down
to the river. Now there was a great calm at that time in the
river; wherefore Mr. Stand-fast, when he was about half-way in,
he stood awhile, and talked to his companions that had waited
upon him thither. And he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>This river has been a terror to many; yea, the thoughts of it
also have often frighted me. But now methinks I stand easy;
my foot is fixed upon that upon which the feet of the priests
that bare the ark of the covenant stood, while Israel went over
this Jordan. The waters indeed are to the palate bitter and to
the stomach cold, yet the thought of what I am going to and of
the conduct that waits for me on the other side, doth lie as a
glowing coal at my heart.</p>

<p>I see myself now at the end of my journey; my toilsome days
are ended. I am going now to see that Head that was crowned
with thorns, and that Face that was spit upon for me.</p>

<p>I have formerly lived by hearsay and faith, but now I go
where I shall live by sight, and shall be with him in whose
company I delight myself.</p>

<p>I have loved to hear my Lord spoken of, and wherever I
have seen the print of his shoe in the earth, there I have coveted
to set my foot too.</p>

<p>His name has been to me as a civet-box, yea, sweeter than
all perfumes. His voice to me has been most sweet, and his
countenance I have more desired than they that have most
desired the light of the sun. His Word I did use to gather for
my food, and for antidotes against my faintings. He has held
me, and I have kept me from mine iniquities; yea, my steps
hath he strengthened in his way.</p>

<p>Now while he was thus in discourse, his countenance changed,
his strong man bowed under him, and after he had said, Take
me, for I come unto thee, he ceased to be seen of them.</p>

<p>But glorious it was to see how the open region was filled
with horses and chariots, with trumpeters and pipers, with singers
and players on stringed instruments, to welcome the pilgrims
as they went up, and followed one another in at the beautiful
gate of the city.</p>

<h2><a name="GOTTFRIED_AUGUST_BURGER" id="GOTTFRIED_AUGUST_BURGER"></a>GOTTFRIED AUGUST BÃœRGER</h2>

<p class="subtitle">(1747-1794)</p>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/cap_t.png" title="" alt="T" width="73" height="73" class="cap" />
<p class="cap_1"><span class="dcap">The</span> ballad of 'Lenore,' upon which BÃ¼rger's fame chiefly rests,
was published in 1773. It constituted one of the articles in
that declaration of independence which the young poets of
the time were formulating, and it was more than a mere coincidence
that in the same year Herder wrote his essay on 'Ossian' and the
'Songs of Ancient Peoples,' and Goethe unfurled the banner of a
new time in 'GÃ¶tz von Berlichingen.' The artificial and sentimental
trivialities of the pigtail age were superseded almost at a stroke, and
the petty formalism under which the literature
of Germany was languishing fell
about the powdered wigs of its professional
representatives. The new impulse came
from England. As in France, Rousseau,
preaching the gospel of a return to nature,
found his texts in English writers, so in
Germany the poets who inaugurated the
classic age derived their chief inspiration
from the wholesome heart of England. It
was Shakespeare that inspired Goethe's
'GÃ¶tz'; Ossian and the old English and
Scotch folk-songs were Herder's theme; and
Percy's 'Reliques' stimulated and saved the genius of BÃ¼rger. This
was the movement which, for lack of a better term, has been called
the naturalistic. Literature once more took possession of the whole
range of human life and experience, descending from her artificial
throne to live with peasant and people. These ardent innovators
spurned all ancient rules and conventions, and in the first ecstasy of
their new-found freedom and unchastened strength it is no wonder
that they went too far. Goethe and Schiller learned betimes the
salutary lesson of artistic restraint. BÃ¼rger never learned it.</p></div>

<p class="caption">Gottfried A. BÃ¼rger</p>
</div>

<p>BÃ¼rger was wholly a child of his time. At the age of twenty-six
he wrote 'Lenore,' and his genius never again attained that height.
Much may be accomplished in the first outburst of youthful energy;
but without the self-control which experience should teach, and without
the moral character which is the condition of great achievement,
genius rots ere it is ripe; and this was the case with BÃ¼rger. We
are reminded of Burns. Goethe in his seventy-eighth year said to
Eckermann:&mdash;"What songs BÃ¼rger and Voss have written! Who<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2768" name="page2768">2768</a></span>
would say that they are less valuable or less redolent of their native
soil than the exquisite songs of Burns?" Like Burns, BÃ¼rger was of
humble origin; like Burns, he gave passion and impulse the reins and
drove to his own destruction; like Burns, he left behind him a body
of truly national and popular poetry which is still alive in the mouths
of the people.</p>

<p>BÃ¼rger was born in the last hour of the year 1747 at Molmerswende.
His father was a country clergyman, and he himself was sent to Halle
at the age of seventeen to study theology. His wild life there led
to his removal to GÃ¶ttingen, where he took up the study of law. He
became a member and afterwards the leader of the famous "GÃ¶ttinger
Dichterbund," and was carried away and for a time rescued from
his evil courses by his enthusiasm for Shakespeare and Percy's 'Reliques.'
He contributed to the newly established Musenalmanach, and
from 1779 until his death in 1794 he was its editor. In 1787 the university
conferred an honorary degree upon him, and he was soon afterward
made a professor without salary, lecturing on Kantian philosophy
and Ã¦sthetics. Three times he was married; his days were full of
financial struggles and self-wrought misery; there is little in his private
life that is creditable to record: a dissolute youth was followed
by a misguided manhood, and he died in his forty-seventh year.</p>

<p>It fell to the lot of the young Goethe, then an unknown reviewer,
to write for the Frankfurter Gelehrte Anzeigen in November, 1772, a
notice of some of BÃ¼rger's early poems. "The 'Minnelied' of Mr.
BÃ¼rger," he says, "is worthy of a better age; and if he has more
such happy moments, these efforts of his will be among the most
potent influences to render our sentimental poetasters, with their
gold-paper Amors and Graces and their elysium of benevolence and
philanthropy, utterly forgotten." With such clear vision could Goethe
see at the age of twenty-three. But he soon saw also the danger
that lay in unbridled freedom. For the best that was in BÃ¼rger
Goethe retained his admiration to the last, but before he was thirty
he felt that their ways had parted. Among the 'Maxims and Reflections'
we find this note:&mdash;"It is sad to see how an extraordinary
man may struggle with his time, with his circumstances, often even
with himself, and never prosper. Sad example, BÃ¼rger!"</p>

<p>Doubtless German literature owes less to BÃ¼rger than English
owes to Burns, but it owes much. BÃ¼rger revived the ballad form
in which so much of the finest German poetry has since been cast.
With his lyric gifts and his dramatic power, he infused a life into
these splendid poems that has made them a part of the folk-lore of
his native land. 'Lenardo und Blandine,' his own favorite, 'Des
Pfarrers Tochter von Taubenhain' (The Pastor's Daughter of Taubenhain),
'Das Lied vom braven Mann' (The Song of the Brave<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2769" name="page2769">2769</a></span>
Man), 'Die Weiber von Weinsberg' (The Women of Weinsberg), 'Der
Kaiser und der Abt' (The Emperor and the Abbot), 'Der Wilde
JÃ¤ger' (The Wild Huntsman), all belong, like 'Lenore,' to the literary
inheritance of the German people. BÃ¼rger attempted a translation
of the Iliad in iambic blank verse, and a prose translation of
'Macbeth.' To him belongs also the credit of having restored to
German literature the long-disused sonnet. His sonnets are among
the best in the language, and elicited warm praise from Schiller as
"models of their kind." Schiller had written a severe criticism of
BÃ¼rger's poems, which had inflamed party strife and embittered the
last years of BÃ¼rger himself; but even Schiller admits that BÃ¼rger
is as much superior to all his rivals as he is inferior to the ideal he
should have striven to attain.</p>

<p>The debt which BÃ¼rger owed to English letters was amply repaid.
In 'Lenore' he showed Percy's 'Reliques' the compliment of quoting
from the ballad of 'Sweet William,' which had supplied him with
his theme, the lines:&mdash;"Is there any room at your head, Willie, or
any room at your feet?" The first literary work of Walter Scott
was the translation which he made in 1775 of 'Lenore,' under the
title of 'William and Helen'; this was quickly followed by a translation
of 'The Wild Huntsman.' Scott's romantic mind received in
BÃ¼rger's ballads and in Goethe's 'GÃ¶tz,' which he translated four
years later, just the nourishment it craved. It is a curious coincidence
that another great romantic writer, Alexandre Dumas, should
also have begun his literary career with a translation of 'Lenore.'
BÃ¼rger was not, however, a man of one poem. He filled two goodly
volumes, but the oft-quoted words of his friend Schlegel contain
the essential truth:&mdash;"'Lenore' will always be BÃ¼rger's jewel, the
precious ring with which, like the Doge of Venice espousing the sea,
he married himself to the folk-song forever."</p>

<p class="subtitle">(1729-1797)</p>

<p class="subtitle">BY E. L. GODKIN</p>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/cap_e.png" title="" alt="E" width="75" height="75" class="cap" />
<p class="cap_1"><span class="dcap">Edmund Burke</span>, born in Dublin, Ireland, in 1729, was the son
of a successful attorney, who gave him as good an education
as the times and the country afforded. He went to
school to an excellent Quaker, and graduated at Trinity College in
1748. He appears to have then gone to London in 1750 to "keep
terms," as it was called, at the Middle Temple, with the view of
being admitted to the bar, in obedience to his father's desire and
ambition. But the desultory habit of mind, the preference for literature
and philosophical speculation to connected study, which had
marked his career in college, followed him and prevented any serious
application to the law. His father's patience was after a while
exhausted, and he withdrew Burke's allowance and left him to his
own resources.</p></div>

<p>This was in 1755, but in 1756 he married, and made his first
appearance in the literary world by the publication of a book.
About these years from 1750 to 1759 little is known. He published
two works, one a treatise on the 'Origin of our Ideas of the Sublime
and Beautiful,' and the other a 'Vindication of Natural Society,' a
satire on Bolingbroke. Stray allusions and anecdotes about other
men in the diaries and correspondence of the time show that he
frequented the literary coffee-houses, and was gradually making an
impression on the authors and wits whom he met there. Besides the
two books we have mentioned, he produced some smaller things,
such as an 'Essay on the Drama,' and part of an 'Abridgment of
the History of England.' But although these helped to secure him
admission to the literary set, they did not raise him out of the rank
of obscure literary adventurers, who from the Revolution of 1688,
and especially after the union with Scotland, began to swarm to
London from all parts of the three kingdoms. The first recognition
of him as a serious writer was his employment by Dodsley the bookseller,
at a salary of $100 a year, to edit the Annual Register, which
Dodsley founded in 1769. Considered as a biographical episode, this
may fairly be treated as a business man's certificate that Burke was
industrious and accurate. As his income from his father was withdrawn
or reduced in 1755, there remain four years during which his
way of supporting himself is unknown. His published works were<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2780" name="page2780">2780</a></span>
certainly not "pot-boilers." He was probably to some extent dependent
on his wife's father, Dr. Nugent, an Irish physician who
when Burke made his acquaintance lived in Bath, but after his
daughter's marriage settled in London, and seems to have frequented
and have been acceptable in the same coffee-houses as Burke, and
for the same reasons. But Burke was not a man to remain long
dependent on any one. These nine years were evidently not spent
fruitlessly. They had made him known and brought him to the
threshold of public life.</p>

<p>In 1759, political discussion as we understand it&mdash;that is, those
explorations of the foundations of political society and analyses of
social relations which now form our daily intellectual food&mdash;was
hardly known. The interest in religion as the chief human concern
was rapidly declining. The interest in human society as an organism
to be studied, and if need be, taken to pieces and put together again,
was only just beginning. Montesquieu's great work, 'The Spirit of
the Laws,' which demanded for expediency and convenience in legislation
the place which modern Europe had long assigned to authority,
had only appeared in 1748. Swift's satires had made serious breaches
in the wall of convention by which the State, in spite of the convulsions
of the seventeenth century, was still surrounded. But the
writer whose speculations excited most attention in England was
Bolingbroke. The charm of his style and the variety of his interests
made him the chief intellectual topic of the London world in Burke's
early youth. To write like Bolingbroke was a legitimate ambition for
a young man. It is not surprising that Burke felt it, and that his
earliest political effort was a satire on Bolingbroke. It attracted the
attention of a politician, Gerard Hamilton, and he quickly picked up
Burke as his secretary, treated him badly, and was abandoned by
him in disgust at the end of six years.</p>

<p>The peculiar condition of the English governmental machine made
possible for men of Burke's kind at this period what would not be
possible now. The population had vanished from a good many old
boroughs, although their representation in Parliament remained, and
the selection of the members fell to the lords of the soil. About one
hundred and fifty members of the House of Commons were in this
way chosen by great landed proprietors, and it is to be said to their
credit that they used their power freely to introduce unknown young
men of talent into public life. Moreover in many cases, if not in
most, small boroughs, however well peopled, were expected to elect
the proprietor's nominee. Burke after leaving Hamilton's service
was for a short time private secretary to Lord Rockingham, when
the latter succeeded Grenville in the Ministry in 1766; but when he
went out, Burke obtained a seat in Parliament in 1765 in the manner<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2781" name="page2781">2781</a></span>
we have described, for the borough of Wendover, from Lord Verney,
who owned it. He made his first successful speech the same year,
and was complimented by Pitt. He was already recognized as a man
of enormous information, as any one who edited the Annual Register
had to be.</p>

<p class="caption">Edmund Burke.</p>
</div>

<p>A man of such powers and tastes in that day naturally became a
pamphleteer. Outside of Parliament there was no other mode of discussing
public affairs. The periodical press for purposes of discussion
did not exist. During and after the Great Rebellion, the pamphlet
had made its appearance as the chief instrument of controversy.
Defoe used it freely after the Restoration. Swift made a great hit
with it, and probably achieved the first sensational sale with his
pamphlet on 'The Conduct of the Allies.' Bolingbroke's 'Patriot
King' was a work of the same class. As a rule the pamphlet exposed
or refuted somebody, even if it also freely expounded. It was
inevitable that Burke should early begin to wield this most powerful
of existing weapons. His antagonist was ready for him in the person
of George Grenville, the minister who had made way for Burke's
friend and patron Lord Rockingham. Grenville showed, as easily
as any party newspaper in our own day, that Rockingham and his
friends had ruined the country by mismanagement of the war and of
the finances. Burke refuted him with a mastery of facts and figures,
and a familiarity with the operations of trade and commerce, and a
power of exposition and illustration, and a comprehension of the
fundamental conditions of national economy, which at once made him
famous and a necessary man for the Whigs in the great struggle
with the Crown on which they were entering.</p>

<p>The nature of this struggle cannot be better described in brief
space than by saying that the King, from his accession to the throne
down to the close of the American War, was engaged in a persistent
effort to govern through ministers chosen and dismissed, as the German
ministers are now, by himself; while the subservience of Parliament
was secured by the profuse use of pensions and places. To
this attempt, and all the abuses which inevitably grew out of it, the
Whigs with Burke as their intellectual head offered a determined
resistance, and the conflict was one extraordinarily well calculated to
bring his peculiar powers into play.</p>

<p>The leading events in this long struggle were the attempt of the
House of Commons to disqualify Wilkes for a seat in the House, to
punish reporting their debates as a breach of privilege, and the
prosecution of the war against the American colonies. It may be
said to have begun at the accession of the King, and to have lasted
until the resignation of Lord North after the surrender of Cornwallis,
or from 1770 to 1783.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page2782" name="page2782">2782</a></span>
Burke's contributions to it were his pamphlet, 'Thoughts on the
Cause of the Present Discontents,' and several speeches in Parliament:
the first, like the pamphlet, on the general situation, and
others on minor incidents in the struggle. This pamphlet has not
only survived the controversy, but has become one of the most
famous papers in the political literature of the Anglo-Saxon race. It
is a century since every conspicuous figure in the drama passed
away; it is seventy years since every trace of the controversy disappeared
from English political life; most if not all of the principles
for which Burke contended have become commonplaces of English
constitutional practice; the discontents of that day have vanished as
completely as those of 1630: but Burke's pamphlet still holds a high
place in every course of English literature, and is still read and
pondered by every student of constitutional history and by every
speculator on government and political morals.</p>

<p>In 1774 Parliament was dissolved for the second time since Burke
entered it: and there a misfortune overtook him which illustrated in
a striking way the practical working of the British Constitution at
that period. Lord Verney, to whom he had owed his seat for the
borough of Wendover at two elections, had fallen into pecuniary
embarrassment and could no longer return him, because compelled
to sell his four boroughs. This left Burke high and dry, and he was
beginning to tremble for his political future, when he was returned
for the great commercial city of Bristol by a popular constituency.
The six years during which he sat for Bristol were the most splendid
portion of his career. Other portions perhaps contributed as
much if not more to his literary or oratorical reputation; but this
brought out in very bold relief the great traits of character which
will always endear his memory to the lovers of national liberty, and
place him high among the framers of great political ideals. In the
first place, he propounded boldly to the Bristol electors the theory
that he was to be their representative but not their delegate; that
his parliamentary action must be governed by his own reason and
not by their wishes. In the next, he resolutely sacrificed his seat by
opposing his constituents in supporting the removal of the restrictions
on Irish trade, of which English merchants reaped the benefit.
He would not be a party to what he considered the oppression of
his native country, no matter what might be the effect on his political
prospects; and in 1780 he was not re-elected.</p>

<p>But the greatest achievement of this period of his history was his
share in the controversy over the American War, which was really
not more a conflict with the colonies over taxation, than a resolute
and obstinate carrying out of the King's principles of government.
The colonies were, for the time being, simply resisting pretensions<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2783" name="page2783">2783</a></span>
to which the kingdom at home submitted. Burke's speeches on
'American Taxation' (1774), on 'Conciliation with America' (1775),
and his 'Letter to the Sheriffs of Bristol' (1777) on the same subject,
taken as a sequel to the 'Thoughts on the Present Discontents,'
form a body of literature which it is not too much to pronounce not
only a history of the dispute with the colonies, but a veritable political
manual. He does not confine himself to a minute description of
the arguments used in supporting the attempt to coerce America; he
furnishes as he goes along principles of legislation applicable almost
to any condition of society; illustrations which light up as by a single
flash problems of apparently inscrutable darkness; explanations
of great political failures; and receipts innumerable for political happiness
and success. A single sentence often disposes of half a dozen
fallacies firmly imbedded in governmental tradition. His own description
of the rhetorical art of Charles Townshend was eminently
applicable to himself:&mdash;"He knew, better by far than any man I
ever was acquainted with, how to bring together within a short time
all that was necessary to establish, to illustrate, and to decorate that
side of the question which he supported."</p>

<p>This observation suggests the great advantage he derives as a
political instructor from the facts that all his political speeches and
writings are polemical. The difficulty of keeping exposition from
being dry is familiar to everybody who has ever sought to communicate
knowledge on any subject. But Burke in every one of his
political theses had an antagonist, who was literally as he says himself,
a helper: who did the work of an opposing counsel at the bar,
in bringing out into prominence all the weak points of Burke's case
and all the strong ones of his own; who set in array all the fallacies
to be exposed, all the idols to be overthrown, all the doubts to be
cleared up. Moreover he was not, like the man who usually figures
in controversial dialogues, a sham opponent, but a creature of flesh
and blood like Grenville, or the Sheriffs of Bristol, or the King's
friends, or the Irish Protestant party, who met Burke with an ardor
not inferior to his own. We consequently have, in all his papers
and speeches, the very best of which he was capable in thought and
expression, for he had not only to watch the city but to meet the
enemy in the gate.</p>

<p>After the close of the American War, the remainder of Burke's
career was filled with two great subjects, to which he devoted himself
with an ardor which occasionally degenerated into fanaticism.
One was the government of India by the East India Company, and
the other was the French Revolution. Although the East India
Company had been long in existence, and had towards the middle
of the eighteenth century been rapidly extending its power and<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2784" name="page2784">2784</a></span>
influence, comparatively little had been known by the English public
of the nature of its operations. Attention had been drawn away
from it by the events in America and the long contest with the
King in England. By the close of the American War, however, the
"Nabobs," as they were called,&mdash;or returned English adventurers,&mdash;began
to make a deep impression on English society by the apparent
size of their fortunes and the lavishness of their expenditure.
Burke calculated that in his time they had brought home about
$200,000,000, with which they bought estates and seats in Parliament
and became a very conspicuous element in English public and private
life. At the same time, information as to the mode in which
their money was made and their government carried on was scanty
and hard to acquire. The press had no foreign correspondence;
India was six months away, and all the Europeans in it were either
servants of the Company, or remained in it on the Company's sufferance.
The Whigs finally determined to attempt a grand inquisition
into its affairs, and a bill was brought in by Fox, withdrawing
the government of India from the Company and vesting it in a commission
named in the bill. This was preceded by eleven reports
from a Committee of Inquiry. But the bill failed utterly, and
brought down the Whig ministry, which did not get into office again
in Burke's time. This was followed in 1785, on Burke's instigation,
by the impeachment of the most conspicuous of the Company's officers,
Warren Hastings. Burke was appointed one of the managers
on behalf of the Commons.</p>

<p>No episode in his career is so familiar to the public as his conduct
of this trial, owing to Warren Hastings having been the subject
of one of the most popular of Macaulay's Essays. None brought out
more clearly Burke's great dialectical powers, or so well displayed
his mastery of details and his power of orderly exposition. The
trial lasted eight years, and was adjourned over from one Parliamentary
session to another. These delays were fatal to its success.
The public interest in it died out long before the close, as usual in
protracted legal prosecutions; the feeling spread that the defendant
could not be very guilty when it took so long to prove his crime.
Although Burke toiled over the case with extraordinary industry and
persistence, and an enthusiasm which never flagged, Hastings was
finally acquitted.</p>

<p>But the labors of the prosecution were not wholly vain. It awoke
in England an attention to the government of India which never
died out, and led to a considerable curtailing of the power of the
East India Company, and necessarily of its severity, in dealing with
Indian States. The impeachment was preceded by eleven reports
on the affairs of India by the Committee of the House of Commons,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2785" name="page2785">2785</a></span>
and the articles of impeachment were nearly as voluminous. Probably
no question which has ever come before Parliament has received
so thorough an examination. Hardly less important was the report
of the Committee of the Commons (which consisted of the managers
of the impeachment) on the Lords' journals. This was an elaborate
examination of the rules of evidence which govern proceedings in
the trial of impeachments, or of persons guilty of malfeasance in
office. This has long been a bone of contention between lawyers
and statesmen. The Peers in the course of the trial had taken the
opinion of the judges frequently, and had followed it in deciding on
the admissibility of evidence, a great deal of which was important to
the prosecution. The report maintained, and with apparently unanswerable
force, that when a legislature sits on offenses against the
State, it constitutes a grand inquest which makes its own rules of
evidence; and is not and ought not to be tied up by the rules
administered in the ordinary law courts, and formed for the most
part for the guidance of the unskilled and often uneducated men
who compose juries. As a manual for the instruction of legislative
committees of inquiry it is therefore still very valuable, if it be not
a final authority.</p>

<p>Burke, during and after the Warren Hastings trial, fell into considerable
neglect and unpopularity. His zeal in the prosecution had
grown as the public interest in it declined, until it approached the
point of fanaticism. He took office in the coalition which succeeded
the Fox Whigs, and when the French Revolution broke out it found
him somewhat broken in nerves, irritated by his failures, and in less
cordial relations with some of his old friends and colleagues. He at
once arrayed himself fiercely against the Revolution, and broke finally
with what might be called the Liberty of all parties and creeds, and
stood forth to the world as the foremost champion of authority, prescription,
and precedent. Probably none of his writings are so familiar
to the general public as those which this crisis produced, such as
the 'Thoughts on the French Revolution' and the 'Letters on a
Regicide Peace.' They are and will always remain, apart from the
splendor of the rhetoric, extremely interesting as the last words
spoken by a really great man on behalf of the old order. Old
Europe made through him the best possible defense of itself. He
told, as no one else could have told it, the story of what customs,
precedent, prescription, and established usage had done for its civilization;
and he told it nevertheless as one who was the friend
of rational progress, and had taken no small part in promoting it.
Only one other writer who followed him came near equaling him as
a defender of the past, and that was Joseph de Maistre; but he
approached the subject mainly from the religious side. To him the
old rÃ©gime was the order of Providence. To Burke it was the best<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2786" name="page2786">2786</a></span>
scheme of things that humanity could devise for the advancement
and preservation of civilization. In the papers we have mentioned,
which were the great literary sensations of Burke's day, everything
that could be said for the system of political ethics under which
Europe had lived for a thousand years was said with a vigor, incisiveness,
and wealth of illustration which must make them for all
time and in all countries the arsenal of those who love the ancient
ways and dread innovation.</p>

<p>The failure of the proceedings against Warren Hastings, and the
strong sympathy with the French Revolution&mdash;at least in its beginning&mdash;displayed
by the Whigs and by most of those with whom
Burke had acted in politics, had an unfortunate effect on his temper.
He broke off his friendship with Fox and others of his oldest associates
and greatest admirers. He became hopeless and out of conceit
with the world around him. One might have set down some of this
at least to the effect of advancing years and declining health, if such
onslaughts on revolutionary ideas as his 'Reflections on the French
Revolution' and his 'Letters on a Regicide Peace' did not reveal
the continued possession of all the literary qualities which had made
the success of his earlier works. Their faults are literally the faults
of youth: the brilliancy of the rhetoric, the heat of the invective,
the violence of the partisanship, the reluctance to admit the existence
of any grievances in France to justify the popular onslaught on
the monarchy, the noblesse, and the Church. His one explanation of
the crisis and its attendant horrors was the instigation of the spirit
of evil. The effect on contemporary opinion was very great, and
did much to stimulate the conservative reaction in England which
carried on the Napoleonic wars and lasted down to the passage of
the Reform Bill in 1832.</p>

<p>There were, however, other causes for the cloud which came
over Burke's later years. In spite of his great services to his party
and his towering eminence as an orator and writer, he never obtained
a seat in the Cabinet. The Paymastership of the Forces, at a
salary of $20,000 a year, was the highest reward, either in honor or
money, which his party ever bestowed on him. It is true that in
those days the Whigs were very particular in reserving high places
for men of rank and family. In fact, their government was, from
the Revolution of 1688 on, a thorough oligarchy, divided among a
few great houses. That they should not have broken through this
rule in Burke's case, and admitted to the Cabinet a man to whom
they owed so much as they did to him, excited wonder in his own
day, and has down to our own time been one of the historical
mysteries on which the students of that period love to expend
their ingenuity. It is difficult to reconcile this exclusion and neglect
of Burke with the unbounded admiration lavished on him by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2787" name="page2787">2787</a></span>
aristocratic leaders of the party. It is difficult too to account for
Burke's quiet acquiescence in what seems to be their ingratitude.
There had before his time been no similar instance of party indifference
to such claims as he could well make, on such honors and
rewards as the party had to bestow.</p>

<p>The most probable explanation of the affair is the one offered by
his latest and ablest biographer, Mr. John Morley. Burke had entered
public life without property,&mdash;probably the most serious mistake, if
in his case it can be called a mistake, which an English politician
can commit. It is a wise and salutary rule of English public life
that a man who seeks a political career shall qualify for it by
pecuniary independence. It would be hardly fair in Burke's case
to say that he had sought a political career. The greatness of his
talents literally forced it on him. He became a statesman and
great Parliamentary orator, so to speak, in spite of himself. But he
must have early discovered the great barrier to complete success
created by his poverty. He may be said to have passed his life in
pecuniary embarrassment. This alone might not have shut him out
from the Whig official Paradise, for the same thing might have been
said of Pitt and Fox: but they had connections; they belonged by
birth and association to the Whig class. Burke's relatives were no
help or credit to him. In fact, they excited distrust of him. They
offended the fastidious aristocrats with whom he associated, and combined
with his impecuniousness to make him seem unsuitable for a
great place. These aristocrats were very good to him. They lent
him money freely, and settled a pension on him, and covered him
with social adulation; but they were never willing to put him beside
themselves in the government. His latter years therefore had an air
of tragedy. He was unpopular with most of those who in his earlier
years had adored him, and was the hero of those whom in earlier
years he had despised. His only son, of whose capacity he had
formed a strange misconception, died young, and he passed his own
closing hours, as far as we can judge, with a sense of failure. But
he left one of the great names in English history. There is no trace
of him in the statute book, but he has, it is safe to say, exercised a
profound influence in all succeeding legislation, both in England and
America. He has inspired or suggested nearly all the juridical
changes which distinguish the England of to-day from the England
of the last century, and is probably the only British politician whose
speeches and pamphlets, made for immediate results, have given him
immortality.</p>

<h3><a name="FROM_THE_SPEECH_ON_CONCILIATION_WITH_AMERICA" id="FROM_THE_SPEECH_ON_CONCILIATION_WITH_AMERICA"></a>FROM THE SPEECH ON 'CONCILIATION WITH AMERICA'</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="dcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;It is not a pleasant consideration; but nothing in the
world can read so awful and so instructive a lesson as the
conduct of the Ministry in this business, upon the mischief
of not having large and liberal ideas in the management of great
affairs. Never have the servants of the State looked at the whole
of your complicated interests in one connected view. They have
taken things by bits and scraps, some at one time and one pretense
and some at another, just as they pressed, without any
sort of regard to their relations or dependencies. They never
had any kind of system, right or wrong; but only invented occasionally
some miserable tale for the day, in order meanly
to sneak out of difficulties into which they had proudly strutted.
And they were put to all these shifts and devices, full of meanness
and full of mischief, in order to pilfer piecemeal a repeal of
an act which they had not the generous courage, when they found
and felt their error, honorably and fairly to disclaim. By such
management, by the irresistible operation of feeble counsels, so
paltry a sum as Threepence in the eyes of a financier, so insignificant
an article as Tea in the eyes of a philosopher, have shaken
the pillars of a commercial empire that circled the whole globe.</p>

<p>Do you forget that in the very last year you stood on the
precipice of general bankruptcy? Your danger was indeed great.
You were distressed in the affairs of the East India Company;
and you well know what sort of things are involved in the comprehensive
energy of that significant appellation. I am not called
upon to enlarge to you on that danger; which you thought proper
yourselves to aggravate, and to display to the world with all the
parade of indiscreet declamation. The monopoly of the most lucrative
trades and the possession of imperial revenues had brought
you to the verge of beggary and ruin. Such was your representation&mdash;such,
in some measure, was your case. The vent of
ten millions of pounds of this commodity, now locked up by the
operation of an injudicious tax and rotting in the warehouses of
the company, would have prevented all this distress, and all that
series of desperate measures which you thought yourselves obliged
to take in consequence of it. America would have furnished that
vent which no other part of the world can furnish but America,
where tea is next to a necessary of life and where the demand<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2789" name="page2789">2789</a></span>
grows upon the supply. I hope our dear-bought East India Committees
have done us at least so much good as to let us know
that without a more extensive sale of that article, our East India
revenues and acquisitions can have no certain connection with
this country. It is through the American trade of tea that your
East India conquests are to be prevented from crushing you with
their burden. They are ponderous indeed, and they must have
that great country to lean upon, or they tumble upon your head.
It is the same folly that has lost you at once the benefit of the
West and of the East. This folly has thrown open folding-doors
to contraband, and will be the means of giving the profits of the
trade of your colonies to every nation but yourselves. Never did
a people suffer so much for the empty words of a preamble. It
must be given up. For on what principles does it stand? This
famous revenue stands, at this hour, on all the debate, as a description
of revenue not as yet known in all the comprehensive
(but too comprehensive!) vocabulary of finance&mdash;<i>a preambulary
tax</i>. It is indeed a tax of sophistry, a tax of pedantry, a tax of
disputation, a tax of war and rebellion, a tax for anything but
benefit to the imposers or satisfaction to the subject....</p>

<p>Could anything be a subject of more just alarm to America
than to see you go out of the plain high-road of finance, and
give up your most certain revenues and your clearest interests,
merely for the sake of insulting your colonies? No man ever
doubted that the commodity of tea could bear an imposition of
threepence. But no commodity will bear threepence, or will
bear a penny, when the general feelings of men are irritated; and
two millions of people are resolved not to pay. The feelings of
the colonies were formerly the feelings of Great Britain. Theirs
were formerly the feelings of Mr. Hampden when called upon
for the payment of twenty shillings. Would twenty shillings
have ruined Mr. Hampden's fortune? No! but the payment of
half twenty shillings, on the principle it was demanded, would
have made him a slave. It is the weight of that preamble of
which you are so fond, and not the weight of the duty, that the
Americans are unable and unwilling to bear.</p>

<p>It is then, sir, upon the <i>principle</i> of this measure, and nothing
else, that we are at issue. It is a principle of political
expediency. Your Act of 1767 asserts that it is expedient to raise
a revenue in America; your Act of 1769, which takes away that
revenue, contradicts the Act of 1767, and by something much<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2790" name="page2790">2790</a></span>
stronger than words asserts that it is not expedient. It is a
reflection upon your wisdom to persist in a solemn Parliamentary
declaration of the expediency of any object for which at the same
time you make no sort of provision. And pray, sir, let not this
circumstance escape you,&mdash;it is very material: that the preamble of
this Act which we wish to repeal is not <i>declaratory of a right</i>,
as some gentlemen seem to argue it; it is only a recital of the
<i>expediency</i> of a certain exercise of a right supposed already to
have been asserted; an exercise you are now contending for by
ways and means which you confess, though they were obeyed, to
be utterly insufficient for their purpose. You are therefore at
this moment in the awkward situation of fighting for a phantom,
a quiddity, a thing that wants not only a substance, but even a
name; for a thing which is neither abstract right nor profitable
enjoyment.</p>

<p>They tell you, sir, that your dignity is tied to it. I know
not how it happens, but this dignity of yours is a terrible incumbrance
to you; for it has of late been ever at war with your
interest, your equity, and every idea of your policy. Show the
thing you contend for to be reason; show it to be common-sense;
show it to be the means of attaining some useful end: and then
I am content to allow it what dignity you please. But what
dignity is derived from the perseverance in absurdity, is more
than ever I could discern. The honorable gentleman has said
well&mdash;indeed, in most of his <i>general</i> observations I agree with
him&mdash;he says that this subject does not stand as it did formerly.
Oh, certainly not! Every hour you continue on this
ill-chosen ground, your difficulties thicken on you; and therefore
my conclusion is, remove from a bad position as quickly as you
can. The disgrace and the necessity of yielding, both of them,
grow upon you every hour of your delay....</p>

<p>To restore order and repose to an empire so great and so
distracted as ours, is, merely in the attempt, an undertaking that
would ennoble the flights of the highest genius and obtain pardon
for the efforts of the meanest understanding. Struggling a
good while with these thoughts, by degrees I felt myself more
firm. I derived at length some confidence from what in other
circumstances usually produces timidity. I grew less anxious,
even from the idea of my own insignificance. For, judging of
what you are by what you ought to be, I persuaded myself that
you would not reject a reasonable proposition because it had<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2791" name="page2791">2791</a></span>
nothing but its reason to recommend it. On the other hand,
being totally destitute of all shadow of influence, natural or
adventitious, I was very sure that if my proposition were futile
or dangerous, if it were weakly conceived or improperly timed,
there was nothing exterior to it of power to awe, dazzle, or
delude you. You will see it just as it is; and you will treat it
just as it deserves.</p>

<p>The proposition is Peace. Not Peace through the medium of
War; not Peace to be hunted through the labyrinth of intricate
and endless negotiations; not Peace to arise out of universal discord,
fomented from principle in all parts of the empire; not
Peace to depend on the juridical determination of perplexing
questions, or the precise marking of the shadowy boundaries of a
complex government. It is simple Peace, sought in its natural
course and in its ordinary haunts. It is Peace sought in the
spirit of Peace, and laid in principles purely pacific. I propose
by removing the ground of the difference, and by restoring the
<i>former unsuspecting confidence of the colonies in the mother country</i>,
to give permanent satisfaction to your people; and (far from
a scheme of ruling by discord) to reconcile them to each other in
the same act and by the bond of the very same interest which
reconciles them to British government.</p>

<p>My idea is nothing more. Refined policy ever has been the
parent of confusion, and ever will be so, as long as the world
endures. Plain good intention, which is as easily discovered at
the first view as fraud is surely detected at last, is, let me say, of
no mean force in the government of mankind. Genuine simplicity
of heart is an healing and cementing principle. My plan, therefore,
being formed upon the most simple grounds imaginable,
may disappoint some people when they hear it. It has nothing
to recommend it to the pruriency of curious ears. There is
nothing at all new and captivating in it. It has nothing of the
splendor of the project which has been lately laid upon your table
by the noble lord in the blue ribbon. It does not propose to fill
your lobby with squabbling colony agents, who will require the
interposition of your mace at every instant to keep the peace
amongst them. It does not institute a magnificent auction of
finance, where captivated provinces come to general ransom by
bidding against each other, until you knock down the hammer,
and determine a proportion of payments beyond all the powers
of algebra to equalize and settle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page2792" name="page2792">2792</a></span>
The plan which I shall presume to suggest derives, however,
one great advantage from the proposition and registry of that
noble lord's project. The idea of conciliation is admissible.
First, the House, in accepting the resolution moved by the noble
lord, has admitted&mdash;notwithstanding the menacing front of our
address, notwithstanding our heavy bills of pains and penalties&mdash;that
we do not think ourselves precluded from all ideas of
free grace and bounty.</p>

<p>The House has gone further: it has declared conciliation admissible,
<i>previous</i> to any submission on the part of America. It
has even shot a good deal beyond that mark, and has admitted
that the complaints of our former mode of exerting the right of
taxation were not wholly unfounded. That right, thus exerted,
is allowed to have something reprehensible in it&mdash;something unwise,
or something grievous: since in the midst of our heat and
resentment we of ourselves have proposed a capital alteration,
and in order to get rid of what seemed so very exceptionable
have instituted a mode that is altogether new; one that is indeed
wholly alien from all the ancient methods and forms of
Parliament.</p>

<p>The <i>principle</i> of this proceeding is large enough for my purpose.
The means proposed by the noble lord for carrying his
ideas into execution, I think indeed are very indifferently suited
to the end; and this I shall endeavor to show you before I sit
down. But for the present I take my ground on the admitted
principle. I mean to give peace. Peace implies reconciliation;
and where there has been a material dispute, reconciliation does
in a manner always imply concession on the one part or on the
other. In this state of things I make no difficulty in affirming
that the proposal ought to originate from us. Great and acknowledged
force is not impaired, either in effect or in opinion,
by an unwillingness to exert itself. The superior power may
offer peace with honor and safety. Such an offer from such a
power will be attributed to magnanimity. But the concessions
of the weak are the concessions of fear. When such a one is
disarmed, he is wholly at the mercy of his superior, and he loses
forever that time and those chances which, as they happen to
all men, are the strength and resources of all inferior power.</p>

<p>The capital leading questions on which you must this day
decide are these two: First, whether you ought to concede; and
secondly, what your concession ought to be. On the first of<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2793" name="page2793">2793</a></span>
these questions we have gained (as I have just taken the liberty
of observing to you) some ground. But I am sensible that a
good deal more is still to be done. Indeed, sir, to enable us to
determine both on the one and the other of these great questions
with a firm and precise judgment, I think it may be necessary to
consider distinctly the true nature and the peculiar circumstances
of the object which we have before us. Because after all our
struggle, whether we will or not, we must govern America
according to that nature and to those circumstances, and not
according to our own imaginations nor according to abstract ideas
of right; by no means according to mere general theories of government,
the resort to which appears to me, in our present situation,
no better than arrant trifling. I shall therefore endeavor,
with your leave, to lay before you some of the most material of
these circumstances in as full and as clear a manner as I am
able to state them.</p>

<h3><a name="FROM_THE_SPEECH_ON_THE_NABOB_OF_ARCOTS_DEBTS" id="FROM_THE_SPEECH_ON_THE_NABOB_OF_ARCOTS_DEBTS"></a>FROM THE SPEECH ON 'THE NABOB OF ARCOT'S DEBTS'</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="dcap">That</span> you may judge what chance any honorable and useful
end of government has for a provision that comes in for
the leavings of these gluttonous demands, I must take it
on myself to bring before you the real condition of that abused,
insulted, racked, and ruined country, though in truth my mind
revolts from it; though you will hear it with horror: and I confess
I tremble when I think on these awful and confounding
dispensations of Providence. I shall first trouble you with a few
words as to the cause.</p>

<p>The great fortunes made in India in the beginnings of conquest
naturally excited an emulation in all the parts, and through
the whole succession, of the company's service. But in the company
it gave rise to other sentiments. They did not find the
new channels of acquisition flow with equal riches to them. On
the contrary, the high flood-tide of private emolument was generally
in the lowest ebb of their affairs. They began also to fear
that the fortune of war might take away what the fortune of
war had given. Wars were accordingly discouraged by repeated
injunctions and menaces; and that the servants might not be
bribed into them by the native princes, they were strictly forbidden
to take any money whatsoever from their hands. But<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2794" name="page2794">2794</a></span>
vehement passion is ingenious in resources. The company's
servants were not only stimulated but better instructed by the
prohibition. They soon fell upon a contrivance which answered
their purposes far better than the methods which were forbidden;
though in this also they violated an ancient, but they thought an
abrogated, order. They reversed their proceedings. Instead of
receiving presents, they made loans. Instead of carrying on
wars in their own name, they contrived an authority, at once
irresistible and irresponsible, in whose name they might ravage
at pleasure; and being thus freed from all restraint, they
indulged themselves in the most extravagant speculations of
plunder. The cabal of creditors who have been the object of
the late bountiful grant from His Majesty's ministers, in order
to possess themselves, under the name of creditors and assignees,
of every country in India as fast as it should be conquered,
inspired into the mind of the Nabob of Arcot (then a <ins class="correction" title="Original was 'dependant'">dependent</ins>
on the company of the humblest order) a scheme of the most
wild and desperate ambition that I believe ever was admitted
into the thoughts of a man so situated. First, they persuaded
him to consider himself as a principal member in the political
system of Europe. In the next place they held out to him, and
he readily imbibed, the idea of the general empire of Indostan.
As a preliminary to this undertaking, they prevailed on him to
propose a tripartite division of that vast country&mdash;one part to
the company; another to the Mahrattas; and the third to himself.
To himself he reserved all the southern part of the great
peninsula, comprehended under the general name of the Deccan.</p>

<p>On this scheme of their servants, the company was to appear
in the Carnatic in no other light than as a contractor for the
provision of armies and hire of mercenaries, for his use and
under his direction. This disposition was to be secured by the
Nabob's putting himself under the guarantee of France, and by
the means of that rival nation preventing the English forever
from assuming an equality, much less a superiority, in the Carnatic.
In pursuance of this treasonable project (treasonable on
the part of the English), they extinguished the company as a
sovereign power in that part of India; they withdrew the company's
garrisons out of all the forts and strongholds of the Carnatic;
they declined to receive the ambassadors from foreign
courts, and remitted them to the Nabob of Arcot; they fell
upon, and totally destroyed, the oldest ally of the company, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2795" name="page2795">2795</a></span>
king of Tanjore, and plundered the country to the amount of
near five millions sterling; one after another, in the Nabob's
name but with English force, they brought into a miserable
servitude all the princes and great independent nobility of a vast
country. In proportion to these treasons and violences, which
ruined the people, the fund of the Nabob's debt grew and flourished.</p>

<p>Among the victims to this magnificent plan of universal plunder,
worthy of the heroic avarice of the projectors, you have all
heard (and he has made himself to be well remembered) of an
Indian chief called Hyder Ali Khan. This man possessed the
western, as the company under the name of the Nabob of Arcot
does the eastern, division of the Carnatic. It was among the
leading measures in the design of this cabal (according to their
own emphatic language) to <i>extirpate</i> this Hyder Ali. They
declared the Nabob of Arcot to be his sovereign, and himself
to be a rebel, and publicly invested their instrument with the
sovereignty of the kingdom of Mysore. But their victim was
not of the passive kind. They were soon obliged to conclude a
treaty of peace and close alliance with this rebel at the gates
of Madras. Both before and since that treaty, every principle of
policy pointed out this power as a natural alliance; and on his
part it was courted by every sort of amicable office. But the
cabinet council of English creditors would not suffer their Nabob
of Arcot to sign the treaty, nor even to give to a prince at
least his equal the ordinary titles of respect and courtesy.
From that time forward, a continued plot was carried on within
the divan, black and white, of the Nabob of Arcot, for the
destruction of Hyder Ali. As to the outward members of the
double, or rather treble, government of Madras, which had
signed the treaty, they were always prevented by some over-ruling
influence (which they do not describe but which cannot
be misunderstood) from performing what justice and interest
combined so evidently to enforce.</p>

<p>When at length Hyder Ali found that he had to do with men
who either would sign no convention, or whom no treaty and no
signature could bind, and who were the determined enemies of
human intercourse itself, he decreed to make the country possessed
by these incorrigible and predestinated criminals a memorable
example to mankind. He resolved, in the gloomy recesses
of a mind capacious of such things, to leave the whole Carnatic<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2796" name="page2796">2796</a></span>
an everlasting monument of vengeance, and to put perpetual
desolation as a barrier between him and those against whom the
faith which holds the moral elements of the world together was
no protection. He became at length so confident of his force, so
collected in his might, that he made no secret whatsoever of his
dreadful resolution. Having terminated his disputes with every
enemy and every rival, who buried their mutual animosities in
their common detestation against the creditors of the Nabob of
Arcot, he drew from every quarter whatever a savage ferocity
could add to his new rudiments in the arts of destruction; and
compounding all the materials of fury, havoc, and desolation into
one black cloud, he hung for a while on the declivities of the
mountains. Whilst the authors of all these evils were idly and
stupidly gazing on this menacing meteor, which blackened all
their horizon, it suddenly burst and poured down the whole of
its contents upon the plains of the Carnatic. Then ensued a
scene of woe, the like of which no eye had seen, no heart conceived,
and which no tongue can adequately tell. All the horrors
of war before known or heard of were mercy to that new havoc.
A storm of universal fire blasted every field, consumed every
house, destroyed every temple. The miserable inhabitants, flying
from their flaming villages, in part were slaughtered; others,
without regard to sex, to age, to the respect of rank, or sacredness
of function,&mdash;fathers torn from children, husbands from
wives,&mdash;enveloped in a whirlwind of cavalry, and amidst the
goading spears of drivers and the trampling of pursuing horses,
were swept into captivity in an unknown and hostile land.
Those who were able to evade this tempest fled to the walled
cities: but escaping from fire, sword, and exile, they fell into
the jaws of famine.</p>

<p>The alms of the settlement in this dreadful exigency were
certainly liberal, and all was done by charity that private charity
could do: but it was a people in beggary; it was a nation which
stretched out its hands for food. For months together these
creatures of sufferance,&mdash;whose very excess of luxury in their
most plenteous days had fallen short of the allowance of our
austerest fasts,&mdash;silent, patient, resigned, without sedition or disturbance,
almost without complaint, perished by an hundred a
day in the streets of Madras; every day seventy at least laid
their bodies in the streets, or on the glacis of Tanjore, and
expired of famine in the granary of India. I was going to<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2797" name="page2797">2797</a></span>
awake your justice towards this unhappy part of our fellow-citizens
by bringing before you some of the circumstances of this
plague of hunger. Of all the calamities which beset and waylay
the life of man, this comes the nearest to our heart, and is that
wherein the proudest of us all feels himself to be nothing more
than he is: but I find myself unable to manage it with decorum;
these details are of a species of horror so nauseous and disgusting,
they are so degrading to the sufferers and to the
hearers, they are so humiliating to human nature itself, that on
better thoughts I find it more advisable to throw a pall over this
hideous object, and to leave it to your general conceptions.</p>

<p>For eighteen months without intermission this destruction
raged from the gates of Madras to the gates of Tanjore; and so
completely did these masters in their art, Hyder Ali and his
more ferocious son, absolve themselves of their impious vow,
that when the British armies traversed, as they did, the Carnatic
for hundreds of miles in all directions, through the whole line
of their march they did not see one man, not one woman, not
one child, not one four-footed beast of any description whatever.
One dead uniform silence reigned over the whole region. With
the inconsiderable exceptions of the narrow vicinage of some few
forts, I wish to be understood as speaking literally;&mdash;I mean to
produce to you more than three witnesses, above all exception,
who will support this assertion in its full extent. That hurricane
of war passed through every part of the central provinces of the
Carnatic. Six or seven districts to the north and to the south
(and those not wholly untouched) escaped the general ravage.</p>

<p>The Carnatic is a country not much inferior in extent to England.
Figure to yourself, Mr. Speaker, the land in whose representative
chair you sit; figure to yourself the form and fashion
of your sweet and cheerful country from Thames to Trent north
and south, and from the Irish to the German Sea east and west,
emptied and emboweled (may God avert the omen of our crimes!)
by so accomplished a desolation. Extend your imagination a
little farther, and then suppose your ministers taking a survey of
this scene of waste and desolation; what would be your thoughts
if you should be informed that they were computing how much
had been the amount of the excises, how much the customs,
how much the land and malt tax, in order that they should
charge (take it in the most favorable light) for public service,
upon the relics of the satiated vengeance of relentless enemies,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2798" name="page2798">2798</a></span>
the whole of what England had yielded in the most exuberant
seasons of peace and abundance? What would you call it? To
call it tyranny sublimed into madness would be too faint an
image; yet this very madness is the principle upon which the
ministers at your right hand have proceeded in their estimate of
the revenues of the Carnatic, when they were providing, not supply
for the establishments of its protection, but rewards for the
authors of its ruin.</p>

<p>Every day you are fatigued and disgusted with this cant:&mdash;"The
Carnatic is a country that will soon recover, and become
instantly as prosperous as ever." They think they are talking to
innocents, who will believe that by sowing of dragons' teeth,
men may come up ready grown and ready armed. They who
will give themselves the trouble of considering (for it requires no
great reach of thought, no very profound knowledge) the manner
in which mankind are increased and countries cultivated, will
regard all this raving as it ought to be regarded. In order that
the people, after a long period of vexation and plunder, may be in
a condition to maintain government, government must begin by
maintaining them. Here the road to economy lies not through
receipt, but through expense; and in that country nature has
given no short cut to your object. Men must propagate, like
other animals, by the mouth. Never did oppression light the
nuptial torch; never did extortion and usury spread out the genial
bed. Does any of you think that England, so wasted, would,
under such a nursing attendance, so rapidly and cheaply recover?
But he is meanly acquainted with either England or India, who
does not know that England would a thousand times sooner
resume population, fertility, and what ought to be the ultimate
secretion from both,&mdash;revenue,&mdash;than such a country as the
Carnatic.</p>

<p>The Carnatic is not by the bounty of nature a fertile soil.
The general size of its cattle is proof enough that it is much
otherwise. It is some days since I moved that a curious and
interesting map kept in the India House should be laid before
you. The India House is not yet in readiness to send it; I have
therefore brought down my own copy, and there it lies for the
use of any gentleman who may think such a matter worthy of
his attention. It is indeed a noble map, and of noble things;
but it is decisive against the golden dreams and sanguine speculations
of avarice run mad. In addition to what you know must<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2799" name="page2799">2799</a></span>
be the case in every part of the world (the necessity of a previous
provision, seed, stock, capital) that map will show you
that the uses of the influences of heaven itself are in that country
a work of art. The Carnatic is refreshed by few or no living
brooks or running streams, and it has rain only at a season;
but its product of rice exacts the use of water subject to perpetual
command. This is the national bank of the Carnatic,
on which it must have a perpetual credit or it perishes irretrievably.
For that reason, in the happier times of India, a number,
almost incredible, of reservoirs have been made in chosen places
throughout the whole country; they are formed for the greater
part of mounds of earth and stones, with sluices of solid
masonry; the whole constructed with admirable skill and labor,
and maintained at a mighty charge. In the territory contained
in that map alone, I have been at the trouble of reckoning the
reservoirs, and they amount to upwards of eleven hundred, from
the extent of two or three acres to five miles in circuit. From
these reservoirs currents are occasionally drawn over the fields,
and these water-courses again call for a considerable expense to
keep them properly scoured and duly leveled. Taking the district
in that map as a measure, there cannot be in the Carnatic
and Tanjore fewer than ten thousand of these reservoirs of the
larger and middling dimensions, to say nothing of those for
domestic services and the uses of religious purification. These
are not the enterprises of your power, nor in a style of magnificence
suited to the taste of your minister. These are the
monuments of real kings, who were the fathers of their people;
testators to a posterity which they embrace as their own. These
are the grand sepulchres built by ambition; but the ambition of
an insatiable benevolence, which, not contented with reigning
in the dispensation of happiness during the contracted term of
human life, had strained, with all the reachings and graspings of
a vivacious mind, to extend the dominion of their bounty beyond
the limits of nature, and to perpetuate themselves through generations
of generations, the guardians, the protectors, the nourishers
of mankind.</p>

<p>Long before the late invasion, the persons who are objects of
the grant of public money now before you had so diverted the
supply of the pious funds of culture and population that everywhere
the reservoirs were fallen into a miserable decay. But
after those domestic enemies had provoked the entry of a cruel<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2800" name="page2800">2800</a></span>
foreign foe into the country, he did not leave it until his revenge
had completed the destruction begun by their avarice. Few,
very few indeed, of these magazines of water that are not either
totally destroyed, or cut through with such gaps as to require
a serious attention and much cost to re-establish them, as the
means of present subsistence to the people and of future revenue
to the State.</p>

<p>What, sir, would a virtuous and enlightened ministry do on
the view of the ruins of such works before them? on the view
of such a chasm of desolation as that which yawned in the midst
of those countries to the north and south, which still bore some
vestiges of cultivation? They would have reduced all their most
necessary establishments; they would have suspended the justest
payments; they would have employed every shilling derived from
the producing, to re-animate the powers of the unproductive,
parts. While they were performing this fundamental duty, whilst
they were celebrating these mysteries of justice and humanity,
they would have told the corps of fictitious creditors whose
crimes were their claims, that they must keep an awful distance;
that they must silence their inauspicious tongues; that they must
hold off their profane, unhallowed paws from this holy work;
they would have proclaimed with a voice that should make itself
heard, that on every country the first creditor is the plow,&mdash;that
this original, indefeasible claim supersedes every other demand.</p>

<p>This is what a wise and virtuous ministry would have done
and said. This, therefore, is what our minister could never
think of saying or doing. A ministry of another kind would
first have improved the country, and have thus laid a solid
foundation for future opulence and future force. But on this
grand point of the restoration of the country, there is not one
syllable to be found in the correspondence of our ministers, from
the first to the last; they felt nothing for a land desolated by
fire, sword, and famine; their sympathies took another direction:
they were touched with pity for bribery, so long tormented with
a fruitless itching of its palms; their bowels yearned for usury,
that had long missed the harvest of its returning months; they
felt for peculation, which had been for so many years raking in
the dust of an empty treasury; they were melted into compassion
for rapine and oppression, licking their dry, parched, unbloody
jaws. These were the objects of their solicitude. These were
the necessities for which they were studious to provide.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page2801" name="page2801">2801</a></span>
To state the country and its revenues in their real condition,
and to provide for those fictitious claims consistently with the
support of an army and a civil establishment, would have been
impossible; therefore the ministers are silent on that head, and
rest themselves on the authority of Lord Macartney, who in a
letter to the court of directors written in the year 1781, speculating
on what might be the result of a wise management of the
countries assigned by the Nabob of Arcot, rates the revenues,
as in time of peace, at twelve hundred thousand pounds a year,
as he does those of the King of Tanjore (which had not been
assigned) at four hundred and fifty. On this Lord Macartney
grounds his calculations, and on this they choose to ground theirs.
It was on this calculation that the ministry, in direct opposition
to the remonstrances of the court of directors, have compelled
that miserable enslaved body to put their hands to an order for
appropriating the enormous sum of Â£480,000 annually, as a fund
for paying to their rebellious servants a debt contracted in defiance
of their clearest and most positive injunctions.</p>

<p>The authority and information of Lord Macartney is held
high on this occasion, though it is totally rejected in every other
particular of this business. I believe I have the honor of being
almost as old an acquaintance as any Lord Macartney has. A
constant and unbroken friendship has subsisted between us from
a very early period; and I trust he thinks that as I respect his
character, and in general admire his conduct, I am one of those
who feel no common interest in his reputation. Yet I do not
hesitate wholly to disallow the calculation of 1781, without any
apprehension that I shall appear to distrust his veracity or his
judgment. This peace estimate of revenue was not grounded
on the state of the Carnatic as it then, or as it had recently,
stood. It was a statement of former and better times. There
is no doubt that a period did exist when the large portion of
the Carnatic held by the Nabob of Arcot might be fairly reputed
to produce a revenue to that, or to a greater amount. But the
whole had so melted away by the slow and silent hostilities of
oppression and mismanagement, that the revenues, sinking with
the prosperity of the country, had fallen to about Â£800,000 a
year even before an enemy's horse had imprinted his hoof on
the soil of the Carnatic. From that view, and independently of
the decisive effects of the war which ensued, Sir Eyre Coote conceived
that years must pass before the country could be restored<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2802" name="page2802">2802</a></span>
to its former prosperity and production. It was that state of
revenue (namely, the actual state before the war) which the
directors have opposed to Lord Macartney's speculation. They
refused to take the revenues for more than Â£800,000. In this
they are justified by Lord Macartney himself, who in a subsequent
letter informs the court that his sketch is a matter of
speculation; it supposes the country restored to its ancient prosperity,
and the revenue to be in a course of effective and honest
collection. If therefore the ministers have gone wrong, they
were not deceived by Lord Macartney: they were deceived by
no man. The estimate of the directors is nearly the very estimate
furnished by the right honorable gentleman himself, and
published to the world in one of the printed reports of his own
committee; but as soon as he obtained his power, he chose to
abandon his account. No part of his official conduct can be
defended on the ground of his Parliamentary information.</p>

<h3><a name="FROM_THE_SPEECH_ON_THE_FRENCH_REVOLUTION" id="FROM_THE_SPEECH_ON_THE_FRENCH_REVOLUTION"></a>FROM THE SPEECH ON 'THE FRENCH REVOLUTION'</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="dcap">When</span> ancient opinions and rules of life are taken away, the
loss cannot possibly be estimated. From that moment
we have no compass to govern us; nor can we know distinctly
to what port we steer. Europe, undoubtedly, taken in a
mass, was in a flourishing condition the day on which your
revolution was completed. How much of that prosperous state
was owing to the spirit of our old manners and opinions is not
easy to say; but as such causes cannot be indifferent in their
operation, we must presume that on the whole their operation
was beneficial.</p>

<p>We are but too apt to consider things in the state in which
we find them, without sufficiently adverting to the causes by
which they have been produced and possibly may be upheld.
Nothing is more certain than that our manners, our civilization,
and all the good things which are connected with manners and
with civilization, have in this European world of ours depended
for ages upon two principles, and were indeed the result of both
combined: I mean the spirit of a gentleman and the spirit of
religion. The nobility and the clergy, the one by profession,
the other by patronage, kept learning in existence even in the
midst of arms and confusions, and whilst governments were<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2803" name="page2803">2803</a></span>
rather in their causes than formed. Learning paid back what it
received to nobility and to priesthood; and paid it with usury,
by enlarging their ideas and by furnishing their minds. Happy
if they had all continued to know their indissoluble union and
their proper place! Happy if learning, not debauched by ambition,
had been satisfied to continue the instructor, and not
aspired to be the master! Along with its natural protectors and
guardians, learning will be cast into the mire and trodden down
under the hoofs of a swinish multitude.</p>

<p>If, as I suspect, modern letters owe more than they are
always willing to own to ancient manners, so do other interests
which we value full as much as they are worth. Even commerce
and trade and manufacture, the gods of our economical
politicians, are themselves perhaps but creatures; are themselves
but effects, which as first causes we choose to worship. They
certainly grew under the same shade in which learning flourished.
They too may decay with their natural protecting principles.
With you, for the present at least, they threaten to
disappear together. Where trade and manufactures are wanting
to a people, and the spirit of nobility and religion remains,
sentiment supplies, and not always ill supplies, their place; but
if commerce and the arts should be lost in an experiment to try
how well a State may stand without these old fundamental principles,
what sort of a thing must be a nation of gross, stupid,
ferocious, and at the same time poor and sordid barbarians,&mdash;destitute
of religion, honor, or manly pride, possessing nothing
at present and hoping for nothing hereafter?</p>

<p>I wish you may not be going fast, and by the shortest cut, to
that horrible and disgustful situation. Already there appears a
poverty of conception, a coarseness and vulgarity, in all the proceedings
of the Assembly and of all their instructors. Their
liberty is not liberal. Their science is presumptuous ignorance.
Their humanity is savage and brutal.</p>

<p>It is not clear whether in England we learned those grand
and decorous principles and manners, of which considerable
traces yet remain, from you, or whether you took them from us.
But to you, I think, we trace them best. You seem to me to
be <i>gentis incunabula nostrÃ¦</i>. France has always more or less influenced
manners in England; and when your fountain is choked
up and polluted the stream will not run long, or not run clear,
with us or perhaps with any nation. This gives all Europe, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2804" name="page2804">2804</a></span>
my opinion, but too close and connected a concern in what is
done in France. Excuse me therefore if I have dwelt too long
on the atrocious spectacle of the 6th of October, 1789, or have
given too much scope to the reflections which have arisen in my
mind on occasion of the most important of all revolutions, which
may be dated from that day,&mdash;I mean a revolution in sentiments,
manners, and moral opinions. As things now stand, with
everything respectable destroyed without us, and an attempt to
destroy within us every principle of respect, one is almost forced
to apologize for harboring the common feelings of men.</p>

<p>Why do I feel so differently from the Reverend Dr. Price
and those of his lay flock who will choose to adopt the sentiments
of his discourse? For this plain reason&mdash;because it is
<i>natural</i> I should; because we are so made as to be affected at
such spectacles with melancholy sentiments upon the unstable
condition of mortal prosperity, and the tremendous uncertainty
of human greatness; because in those natural feelings we learn
great lessons; because in events like these our passions instruct
our reason; because when kings are hurled from their thrones
by the Supreme Director of this great drama, and become the
objects of insult to the base and of pity to the good, we behold
such disasters in the moral as we should a miracle in the physical
order of things. We are alarmed into reflection; our minds
(as it has long since been observed) are purified by terror and
pity; our weak, unthinking pride is humbled under the dispensations
of a mysterious wisdom. Some tears might be drawn
from me, if such a spectacle were exhibited on the stage. I
should be truly ashamed of finding in myself that superficial,
theatric sense of painted distress, whilst I could exult over it in
real life. With such a perverted mind, I could never venture to
show my face at a tragedy. People would think the tears that
Garrick formerly, or that Siddons not long since, have extorted
from me, were the tears of hypocrisy; I should know them to
be the tears of folly.</p>

<p>Indeed, the theatre is a better school of moral sentiments
than churches where the feelings of humanity are thus outraged.
Poets, who have to deal with an audience not yet graduated
in the school of the rights of men, and who must apply
themselves to the moral constitution of the heart, would not dare
to produce such a triumph as a matter of exultation. There,
where men follow their natural impulses, they would not bear<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2805" name="page2805">2805</a></span>
the odious maxims of a Machiavellian policy, whether applied
to the attainment of monarchical or democratic tyranny. They
would reject them on the modern, as they once did on the
ancient stage, where they could not bear even the hypothetical
proposition of such wickedness in the mouth of a personated
tyrant, though suitable to the character he sustained. No theatric
audience in Athens would bear what has been borne in the
midst of the real tragedy of this triumphal day: a principal actor
weighing, as it were in scales hung in a shop of horrors, so
much actual crime against so much contingent advantage, and
after putting in and out weights, declaring that the balance was
on the side of the advantages. They would not bear to see the
crimes of new democracy posted as in a ledger against the
crimes of old despotism, and the book-keepers of politics finding
democracy still in debt, but by no means unable or unwilling
to pay the balance. In the theatre, the first intuitive glance,
without any elaborate process of reasoning, will show that this
method of political computation would justify every extent of
crime. They would see that on these principles, even where the
very worst acts were not perpetrated, it was owing rather to the
fortune of the conspirators than to their parsimony in the expenditure
of treachery and blood. They would soon see that criminal
means, once tolerated, are soon preferred. They present a
shorter cut to the object than through the highway of the moral
virtues. Justifying perfidy and murder for public benefit, public
benefit would soon become the pretext, and perfidy and murder
the end; until rapacity, malice, revenge, and fear more dreadful
than revenge, could satiate their insatiable appetites. Such must
be the consequences of losing, in the splendor of these triumphs
of the rights of men, all natural sense of wrong and right.</p>

<p>But the reverend pastor exults in this "leading in triumph,"
because truly Louis the Sixteenth was "an arbitrary monarch";
that is, in other words, neither more nor less than because he
was Louis the Sixteenth, and because he had the misfortune to
be born King of France, with the prerogatives of which a long
line of ancestors, and a long acquiescence of the people, without
any act of his, had put him in possession. A misfortune it has
indeed turned out to him, that he was born King of France.
But misfortune is not crime, nor is indiscretion always the
greatest guilt. I shall never think that a prince, the acts of
whose whole reign were a series of concessions to his subjects;<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2806" name="page2806">2806</a></span>
who was willing to relax his authority, to remit his prerogatives,
to call his people to a share of freedom not known, perhaps not
desired, by their ancestors: such a prince, though he should be
subjected to the common frailties attached to men and to princes,
though he should have once thought it necessary to provide
force against the desperate designs manifestly carrying on against
his person and the remnants of his authority,&mdash;though all this
should be taken into consideration, I shall be led with great
difficulty to think he deserves the cruel and insulting triumph of
Paris and of Dr. Price. I tremble for the cause of liberty, from
such an example to kings. I tremble for the cause of humanity,
in the unpunished outrages of the most wicked of mankind.
But there are some people of that low and degenerate fashion of
mind that they look up with a sort of complacent awe and
admiration to kings who know how to keep firm in their seat, to
hold a strict hand over their subjects, to assert their prerogative,
and by the awakened vigilance of a severe despotism to guard
against the very first approaches of freedom. Against such as
these they never elevate their voice. Deserters from principle,
listed with fortune, they never see any good in suffering virtue,
nor any crime in prosperous usurpation.</p>

<p>If it could have been made clear to me that the King and
Queen of France (those I mean who were such before the
triumph) were inexorable and cruel tyrants, that they had
formed a deliberate scheme for massacring the National Assembly
(I think I have seen something like the latter insinuated in
certain publications), I should think their captivity just. If this
be true, much more ought to have been done; but done, in my
opinion, in another manner. The punishment of real tyrants is
a noble and awful act of justice; and it has with truth been said
to be consolatory to the human mind. But if I were to punish
a wicked king, I should regard the dignity in avenging the
crime. Justice is grave and decorous, and in its punishments
rather seems to submit to a necessity than to make a choice.
Had Nero, or Agrippina, or Louis the Eleventh, or Charles the
Ninth, been the subject; if Charles the Twelfth of Sweden after
the murder of Patkul, or his predecessor Christina after the
murder of Monaldeschi, had fallen into your hands, sir, or into
mine, I am sure our conduct would have been different.</p>

<p>If the French King, or King of the French (or by whatever
name he is known in the new vocabulary of your constitution),<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2807" name="page2807">2807</a></span>
has in his own person and that of his Queen really deserved these
unavowed but unavenged murderous attempts, and those frequent
indignities more cruel than murder, such a person would ill deserve
even that subordinate executory trust which I understand
is to be placed in him; nor is he fit to be called chief in a nation
which he has outraged and oppressed. A worse choice for such
an office in a new commonwealth than that of a deposed tyrant
could not possibly be made. But to degrade and insult a man
as the worst of criminals, and afterwards to trust him in your
highest concerns as a faithful, honest, and zealous servant, is not
consistent with reasoning, nor prudent in policy, nor safe in
practice. Those who could make such an appointment must be
guilty of a more flagrant breach of trust than any they have yet
committed against the people. As this is the only crime in
which your leading politicians could have acted inconsistently, I
conclude that there is no sort of ground for these horrid insinuations.
I think no better of all the other calumnies.</p>

<p>In England, we give no credit to them. We are generous
enemies: we are faithful allies. We spurn from us with disgust
and indignation the slanders of those who bring us their anecdotes
with the attestation of the flower-de-luce on their shoulder.
We have Lord George Gordon fast in Newgate; and neither his
being a public proselyte to Judaism, nor his having, in his zeal
against Catholic priests and all sorts of ecclesiastics, raised a mob
(excuse the term, it is still in use here) which pulled down all
our prisons, have preserved to him a liberty of which he did not
render himself worthy by a virtuous use of it. We have rebuilt
Newgate, and tenanted the mansion. We have prisons almost as
strong as the Bastile for those who dare to libel the Queens of
France. In this spiritual retreat let the noble libeler remain.
Let him there meditate on his Talmud, until he learns a conduct
more becoming his birth and parts, and not so disgraceful to the
ancient religion to which he has become a proselyte; or until
some persons from your side of the water, to please your new
Hebrew brethren, shall ransom him. He may then be enabled
to purchase, with the old hoards of the synagogue, and a very
small poundage on the long compound interest of the thirty pieces
of silver (Dr. Price has shown us what miracles compound interest
will perform in 1790 years), the lands which are lately discovered
to have been usurped by the Gallican Church. Send us your
Popish Archbishop of Paris, and we will send you our Protestant<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2808" name="page2808">2808</a></span>
Rabbin. We shall treat the person you send us in exchange like
a gentleman and an honest man, as he is; but pray let him
bring with him the fund of his hospitality, bounty, and charity;
and depend upon it, we shall never confiscate a shilling of that
honorable and pious fund, nor think of enriching the treasury
with the spoils of the poor-box.</p>

<p>To tell you the truth, my dear sir, I think the honor of our
nation to be somewhat concerned in the disclaimer of the proceedings
of this society of the Old Jewry and the London Tavern.
I have no man's proxy. I speak only for myself when I disclaim,
as I do with all possible earnestness, all communion with
the actors in that triumph, or with the admirers of it. When I
assert anything else, as concerning the people of England, I
speak from observation, not from authority; but I speak from the
experience I have had in a pretty extensive and mixed communication
with the inhabitants of this kingdom, of all descriptions
and ranks, and after a course of attentive observation begun
early in life, and continued for nearly forty years. I have often
been astonished, considering that we are divided from you but by
a slender dike of about twenty-four miles, and that the mutual
intercourse between the two countries has lately been very great,
to find how little you seem to know of us. I suspect that this is
owing to your forming a judgment of this nation from certain
publications which do very erroneously, if they do at all, represent
the opinions and dispositions generally prevalent in England.
The vanity, restlessness, petulance, and spirit of intrigue of
several petty cabals, who attempt to hide their total want of consequence
in bustle, and noise, and puffing, and mutual quotation
of each other, makes you imagine that our contemptuous neglect
of their abilities is a mark of general acquiescence in their
opinions. No such thing, I assure you. Because half a dozen
grasshoppers under a fern make the field ring with their importunate
chink, whilst thousands of great cattle reposed beneath the
shadow of the British oak chew the cud and are silent, pray do
not imagine that those who make the noise are the only inhabitants
of the field; that of course they are many in number; or
that after all they are other than the little, shriveled, meagre,
hopping, though loud and troublesome, insects of the hour.</p>

<h2><a name="FRANCES_HODGSON_BURNETT" id="FRANCES_HODGSON_BURNETT"></a>FRANCES HODGSON BURNETT</h2>

<p class="subtitle">(1849-)</p>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/cap_m.png" title="" alt="M" width="74" height="75" class="cap" />
<p class="cap_2"><span class="dcap">Mrs. Burnett</span> has told the story of her childhood and tried to
interpret her own personality in her autobiographical story,
'The One I Knew Best of All.' She has pictured a little
English girl in a comfortable Manchester home, leading a humdrum,
well-regulated existence, with brothers and sisters, nurse and governess.
But an alert imagination added interest to the life of this
"Small Person," and from her nursery windows and from the quiet
park where she played she watched eagerly for anything of dramatic
or picturesque interest. She seized upon the Lancashire dialect often
overheard, as upon a game, and practiced it until she gained the
facility of use shown in her mining and factory stories. One day the
strong and beautiful figure of a young woman, followed by a coarse
and abusive father, caught her attention, and years afterward she
developed Joan Lowrie from the incident.</p></div>

<p>When the Hodgson family suffered pecuniary loss, and hoping to
better its fortunes came to America, then best known to Frances
from the pages of 'Uncle Tom's Cabin,' she was fifteen. A year or
two later she began to send her stories to various magazines. In
1867 the first of these appeared. She did not however attain her
great popularity until the appearance of 'That Lass o' Lowrie's'
in 1877. The thoughtfully drawn group of characters&mdash;Derrick
the engineer, Grace the young minister, Annie the rector's daughter,
and Joan the pit girl,&mdash;are dramatic figures, working out their life
problems under the eyes and the comments of half-cynical, half-brutalized
miners. There is nothing in her history to account for
Joan, or for the fact that the strength of vice in her father becomes
an equal strength of virtue in her. Abused since her babyhood, doing
the work of a man among degrading companionships, she yet remains
capable of the noblest self-abnegation. Mrs. Burnett delights in
heroes and heroines who are thus loftily at variance with their surroundings.
Her stories are romantic in spirit, offering little to the
lover of psychologic analysis. Her character-drawing is the product
of quick observation and sympathetic intuition. She does not
write "tendency" novels, but appeals to simple emotions of love,
hate, revenge, or self-immolation, which sometimes, as in the case
of her last book, 'A Lady of Quality' (1895), verge on sensationalism.
In 1873 Miss Hodgson married Dr. Burnett of Washington. Her<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2810" name="page2810">2810</a></span>
longest novel, 'Through One Administration,' is a story of the political
and social life of the Capital. 'Little Lord Fauntleroy' (1886) is
the best known of a series of stories nominally written for children,
but intended to be read by their elders. 'Sara Crewe,' 'Giovanni
and the Other,' 'Two Little Pilgrims,' and 'Little Saint Elizabeth'
are chronicles of superlunary children. After those before mentioned,
'Esmeralda,' 'Louisiana,' 'A Fair Barbarian,' and 'Haworth's' are
her best known stories.</p>

<h3><a name="AT_THE_PIT" id="AT_THE_PIT"></a>AT THE PIT</h3>

<p class="subtitle">From 'That Lass o' Lowrie's'</p>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="dcap">The</span> next morning Derrick went down to the mine as usual.
There were several things he wished to do in these last
two days. He had heard that the managers had entered
into negotiations with a new engineer, and he wished the man
to find no half-done work. The day was bright and frosty, and
the sharp, bracing air seemed to clear his brain. He felt more
hopeful, and less inclined to view matters darkly.</p>

<p>He remembered afterward that as he stepped into the cage he
turned to look at the unpicturesque little town, brightened by the
winter's sun; and that as he went down he glanced up at the
sky, and marked how intense appeared the bit of blue which was
framed in by the mouth of the shaft.</p>

<p>Even in the few hours that had elapsed since the meeting,
the rumor of what he had said and done had been bruited about.
Some collier had heard it and had told it to his comrades, and so
it had gone from one to the other. It had been talked over at
the evening and morning meal in divers cottages, and many an
anxious hand had warmed into praise of the man who had "had
a thowt for th' men."</p>

<p>In the first gallery he entered he found a deputation of men
awaiting him,&mdash;a group of burly miners with picks and shovels
over their shoulders,&mdash;and the head of this deputation, a spokesman
burlier and generally gruffer than the rest, stopped him.</p>

<p>"Mester," he said, "we chaps 'ud loike to ha' a word wi' yo'."</p>

<p>"All right," was Derrick's reply, "I am ready to listen."</p>

<p>The rest crowded nearer, as if anxious to participate as much
as possible, and give their spokesman the support of their presence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page2811" name="page2811">2811</a></span>
"It is na mich as we ha' getten to say," said the man, "but
we're fain to say it. Are na we, mates?"</p>

<p>"Ay, we are, lad," in chorus.</p>

<p>"It's about summat as we'n heerd. Theer wur a chap as towd
some on us last neet as yo'd getten th' sack fro' th' managers&mdash;or
leastways as yo'd turned th' tables on 'em an' gi'en them th'
sack yo'rsen. An' we'n heerd as it begun wi' yo're standin' up
fur us chaps&mdash;axin' fur things as wur wanted i' th' pit to save
us fro' runnin' more risk than we need. An' we heerd as yo'
spoke up bold, an' argied for us an' stood to what yo' thowt war
th' reet thing, an' we set our moinds on tellin' yo' as we'd heerd
it an' talked it over, an' we'd loike to say a word o' thanks i'
common fur th' pluck yo' showed. Is na that it, mates?"</p>

<p>"Ay, that it is, lad!" responded the chorus.</p>

<p>Suddenly one of the group stepped out and threw down his
pick. "An' I'm dom'd, mates," he said, "if here is na a chap as
ud loike to shake hands wi' him."</p>

<p>It was the signal for the rest to follow his example. They
crowded about their champion, thrusting grimy paws into his
hand, grasping it almost enthusiastically.</p>

<p>"Good luck to yo', lad!" said one. "We'n noan smooth soart
o' chaps, but we'n stand by what's fair an' plucky. We shall
ha' a good word fur thee when tha hast made thy flittin'."</p>

<p>"I'm glad of that, lads," responded Derrick heartily, by no
means unmoved by the rough-and-ready spirit of the scene. "I
only wish I had had better luck, that's all."</p>

<p>A few hours later the whole of the little town was shaken to
its very foundations by something like an earthquake, accompanied
by an ominous, booming sound which brought people
flocking out of their houses with white faces. Some of them
had heard it before&mdash;all knew what it meant. From the
colliers' cottages poured forth women, shrieking and wailing,&mdash;women
who bore children in their arms and had older ones
dragging at their skirts, and who made their desperate way to
the pit with one accord. From houses and workshops there
rushed men, who coming out in twos and threes joined each
other, and forming a breathless crowd, ran through the streets
scarcely daring to speak a word&mdash;and all ran toward the pit.</p>

<p>There were scores at its mouth in five minutes; in ten
minutes there were hundreds, and above all the clamor rose the
cry of women:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page2812" name="page2812">2812</a></span></p>
<p>"My mester's down!"</p>

<p>"An' mine!"</p>

<p>"An' mine!"</p>

<p>"Four lads o' mine is down!"</p>

<p>"Three o' mine!"</p>

<p>"My little un's theer&mdash;th' youngest&mdash;nobbut ten year owd&mdash;nobbut
ten year owd, poor little chap! an' ony been at work a
week!"</p>

<p>"Ay, wenches, God ha' mercy on us aw'&mdash;God ha' mercy!"
And then more shrieks and wails, in which the terror-stricken
children joined.</p>

<p>It was a fearful sight. How many lay dead and dying in
the noisome darkness below, God only knew! How many lay
mangled and crushed, waiting for their death, Heaven only could
tell!</p>

<p>In five minutes after the explosion occurred, a slight figure
in clerical garb made its way through the crowd with an air of
excited determination.</p>

<p>"Th' parson's feart," was the general comment.</p>

<p>"My men," he said, raising his voice so that all could hear,
"can any of you tell me who last saw Fergus Derrick?"</p>

<p>There was a brief pause, and then came a reply from a collier
who stood near.</p>

<p>"I coom up out o' th' pit an hour ago," he said, "I wur th'
last as coom up, an' it wur on'y chance as browt me. Derrick
wur wi' his men i' th' new part o' th' mine. I seed him as I
passed through."</p>

<p>Grace's face became a shade or so paler, but he made no
more inquiries.</p>

<p>His friend either lay dead below, or was waiting for his doom
at that very moment. He stepped a little farther forward.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately for myself, at present," he said, "I have no
practical knowledge of the nature of these accidents. Will some
of you tell me how long it will be before we can make our first
effort to rescue the men who are below?"</p>

<p>Did he mean to volunteer&mdash;this young whipper-snapper of a
parson? And if he did, could he know what he was doing?</p>

<p>"I ask you," he said, "because I wish to offer myself as a
volunteer at once; I think I am stronger than you imagine, and
at least my heart will be in the work. I have a friend below&mdash;myself,"
his voice altering its tone and losing its firmness,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2813" name="page2813">2813</a></span>&mdash;"a
friend who is worthy the sacrifice of ten such lives as mine, if
such a sacrifice could save him."</p>

<p>One or two of the older and more experienced spoke up.
Under an hour it would be impossible to make the attempt&mdash;it
might even be a longer time, but in an hour they might at least
make their first effort.</p>

<p>If such was the case, the parson said, the intervening period
must be turned to the best account. In that time much could
be thought of and done which would assist themselves and benefit
the sufferers. He called upon the strongest and most experienced,
and almost without their recognizing the prominence
of his position, led them on in the work. He even rallied the
weeping women and gave them something to do. One was sent
for this necessary article and another for that. A couple of boys
were dispatched to the next village for extra medical assistance,
so that there need be no lack of attention when it was required.
He took off his broadcloth and worked with the rest of them
until all the necessary preparations were made, and it was considered
possible to descend into the mine.</p>

<p>When all was ready, he went to the mouth of the shaft and
took his place quietly.</p>

<p>It was a hazardous task they had before them. Death would
stare them in the face all through its performance. There was
choking after-damp below,&mdash;noxious vapors, to breathe which
was to die; there was the chance of crushing masses falling
from the shaken galleries&mdash;and yet these men left their companions
one by one, and ranged themselves without saying a word
at the curate's side.</p>

<p>"My friends," said Grace, baring his head and raising a feminine
hand,&mdash;"My friends, we will say a short prayer."</p>

<p>It was only a few words. Then the curate spoke again.</p>

<p>"Ready!" he said.</p>

<p>But just at that moment there stepped out from the anguished
crowd a girl, whose face was set and deathly, though there was
no touch of fear upon it.</p>

<p>"I ax yo'," she said, "to let me go wi' yo' and do what I
con. Lasses, some on yo' speak a word for Joan Lowrie!"</p>

<p>There was a breathless start. The women even stopped their
outcry to look at her as she stood apart from them,&mdash;a desperate
appeal in the very quiet of her gesture as she turned to look
about her for some one to speak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page2814" name="page2814">2814</a></span>
"Lasses," she said again, "some on yo' speak a word for Joan
Lowrie!"</p>

<p>There rose a murmur among them then, and the next instant
this murmur was a cry.</p>

<p>"Ay," they answered, "we con aw speak fur yo'. Let her
go, lads! She's worth two o' th' best on yo'. Nowt fears her.
Ay, she mun go, if she will, mun Joan Lowrie! Go, Joan lass,
and we'n not forget thee!"</p>

<p>But the men demurred. The finer instinct of some of them
shrank from giving a woman a place in such a perilous undertaking&mdash;the
coarser element in others rebelled against it.</p>

<p>"We'n ha' no wenches," these said, surlily.</p>

<p>Grace stepped forward. He went to Joan Lowrie and touched
her gently on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"We cannot think of it," he said. "It is very brave and
generous, and&mdash;God bless you!&mdash;but it cannot be. I could not
think of allowing it myself, if the rest would."</p>

<p>"Parson," said Joan, coolly but not roughly, "tha'd ha' hard
work to help thysen, if so be as th' lads wur willin'!"</p>

<p>"But," he protested, "it may be death. I could not bear the
thought of it. You are a woman. We cannot let you risk your
life."</p>

<p>She turned to the volunteers.</p>

<p>"Lads," she cried passionately, "yo' munnot turn me back.
I&mdash;sin I mun tell yo'&mdash;" and she faced them like a queen&mdash;"theer's
a mon down theer as I'd gi' my heart's blood to
save."</p>

<p>They did not know whom she meant, but they demurred no
longer.</p>

<p>"Tak' thy place, wench," said the oldest. "If tha mun, tha
mun."</p>

<p>She took her seat in the cage by Grace, and when she took
it she half turned her face away. But when those above began
to lower them, and they found themselves swinging downward
into what might be to them a pit of death, she spoke to him.</p>

<p>"Theer's a prayer I'd loike yo' to pray," she said. "Pray
that if we mun dee, we may na dee until we ha' done our
work."</p>

<p>It was a dreadful work indeed that the rescuers had to do
in those black galleries. And Joan was the bravest, quickest,
most persistent of all. Paul Grace, following in her wake, found<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2815" name="page2815">2815</a></span>
himself obeying her slightest word or gesture. He worked constantly
at her side, for he at least had guessed the truth. He
knew that they were both engaged in the same quest. When at
last they had worked their way&mdash;lifting, helping, comforting&mdash;to
the end of the passage where the collier had said he last saw
the master, then for one moment she paused, and her companion
with a thrill of pity touched her to attract her attention.</p>

<p>"Let me go first," he said.</p>

<p>"Nay," she answered, "we'n go together."</p>

<p>The gallery was a long and low one, and had been terribly
shaken. In some places the props had been torn away, in others
they were borne down by the loosened blocks of coal. The
dim light of the "Davy" Joan held up showed such a wreck
that Grace spoke to her again.</p>

<p>"You must let me go first," he said with gentle firmness.
"If one of these blocks should fall&mdash;"</p>

<p>Joan interrupted him:&mdash;</p>

<p>"If one on 'em should fall, I'm th' one as it had better fall
on. There is na mony foak as ud miss Joan Lowrie. Yo' ha'
work o' yore own to do."</p>

<p>She stepped into the gallery before he could protest, and he
could only follow her. She went before, holding the Davy high,
so that its light might be thrown as far forward as possible.
Now and then she was forced to stoop to make her way around
a bending prop; sometimes there was a falling mass to be surmounted:
but she was at the front still when they reached the
other end, without finding the object of their search.</p>

<p>"It&mdash;he is na there," she said. "Let us try th' next passage,"
and she turned into it.</p>

<p>It was she who first came upon what they were looking for;
but they did not find it in the next passage, or the next, or
even the next. It was farther away from the scene of the explosion
than they had dared to hope. As they entered a narrow
side gallery, Grace heard her utter a low sound, and the next
minute she was down upon her knees.</p>

<p>"Theer's a mon here," she said. "It's him as we're lookin'
fur."</p>

<p>She held the dim little lantern close to the face,&mdash;a still face
with closed eyes, and blood upon it. Grace knelt down too, his
heart aching with dread.</p>

<p>"Is he&mdash;" he began, but could not finish.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page2816" name="page2816">2816</a></span>
Joan Lowrie laid her hand upon the apparently motionless
breast and waited almost a minute, and then she lifted her own
face, white as the wounded man's&mdash;white and solemn, and wet
with a sudden rain of tears.</p>

<p>"He is na dead," she said. "We ha' saved him."</p>

<p>She sat down upon the floor of the gallery, and lifting his
head, laid it upon her bosom, holding it close, as a mother might
hold the head of her child.</p>

<p>"Mester," she said, "gi' me th' brandy flask, and tak' thou
thy Davy an' go fur some o' the men to help us get him to th'
leet o' day. I'm gone weak at last. I conna do no more. I'll
go wi' him to th' top."</p>

<p>When the cage ascended to the mouth again with its last load
of sufferers, Joan Lowrie came with it, blinded and dazzled by
the golden winter's sunlight as it fell upon her haggard face.
She was holding the head of what seemed to be a dead man
upon her knee. A great shout of welcome rose up from the
bystanders.</p>

<p>She helped them to lay her charge upon a pile of coats and
blankets prepared for him, and then she turned to the doctor who
had hurried to the spot to see what could be done.</p>

<p>"He is na dead," she said. "Lay yore hond on his heart. It
beats yet, Mester,&mdash;on'y a little, but it beats."</p>

<p>"No," said the doctor, "he is not dead&mdash;yet"; with a
breath's pause between the two last words. "If some of you
will help me to put him on a stretcher, he may be carried home,
and I will go with him. There is just a chance for him, poor
fellow, and he must have immediate attention. Where does he
live?"</p>

<p>"He must go with me," said Grace. "He is my friend."</p>

<p>So they took him up, and Joan stood a little apart and
watched them carry him away,&mdash;watched the bearers until they
were out of sight, and then turned again and joined the women
in their work among the sufferers.</p>

<h2><a name="FRANCES_BURNEY_MADAME_DARBLAY" id="FRANCES_BURNEY_MADAME_DARBLAY"></a>FRANCES BURNEY (MADAME D'ARBLAY)</h2>

<p class="subtitle">(1752-1840)</p>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/cap_t.png" title="" alt="T" width="73" height="73" class="cap" />
<p class="cap_1"><span class="dcap">There</span> is a suggestion of the 'Ugly Duckling' story in Fanny
Burney's early life. The personality of the shy little girl,
who was neither especially pretty nor precocious, was
rather merged in the half-dozen of gayer brothers and sisters. The
first eight years of her life were passed at Lynn Regis in Norfolk;
then the family moved to London, where her father continued his
career as an important writer on music and a fashionable music-master.
Soon after, Mrs. Burney died. All the children but young
Fanny were sent away to school. She was
to have been educated at home, but received
little attention from the learned,
kind, but heedless Dr. Burney, who seems
to have considered her the dull member of
his flock. "Poor Fanny!" he often said,
until her sudden fame overwhelmed him
with surprise as well as exultation. Only
his friend, her beloved "Daddy Crisp" of
the letters, appreciated her; himself a disappointed
dramatic author, soured by what
he felt to be an incomprehensible failure,
yet of fine critical talent, with kind and
wise suggestions for his favorite Fanny.</p></div>

<img src="images/illus-0083-2.png" width="174" height="200" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption smcap">Frances Burney</p>
</div>

<p>But while her book-education was of the slightest, her social
advantages were great. Pleasure-loving Dr. Burney had a delightful
faculty of attracting witty and musical friends to enliven his home.
Fanny's great unnoticed gift was power of observation. The shy girl
who avoided notice herself, found her social pleasure in watching
and listening to clever people. Perhaps a Gallic strain&mdash;for her
mother was of French descent&mdash;gave her clear-sightedness. She had
a turn for social satire which added humorous discrimination to her
judgments. She understood people better than books, and perceived
their petty hypocrisies, self-deceptions, and conventional standards,
with witty good sense and love of sincerity. Years of this silent
note-taking and personal intercourse with brilliant people gave her
unusual knowledge of the world.</p>

<p>She was a docile girl, ready always to heed her father and her
"Daddy Crisp," ready to obey her kindly stepmother, and try to
exchange for practical occupations her pet pastime of scribbling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page2818" name="page2818">2818</a></span>
But from the time she was ten she had loved to write down
her impressions, and the habit was too strong to be more than
temporarily renounced. Like many imaginative persons, she was
fond of carrying on serial inventions in which repressed fancies
found expression. One long story she destroyed; but the characters
haunted her, and she began a sequel which became 'Evelina.'
In the young, beautiful, virtuous heroine, with her many mortifying
experiences and her ultimate triumph, she may have found compensation
for a starved vanity of her own.</p>

<p>For a long time she and her sisters enjoyed Evelina's tribulations;
then Fanny grew ambitious, and encouraged by her brother, thought
of publication. When she tremblingly asked her father's consent, he
carelessly countenanced the venture and gave it no second thought.
After much negotiation, a publisher offered twenty pounds for the
manuscript, and in 1778 the appearance of 'Evelina' ended Fanny
Burney's obscurity. For a long time the book was the topic of
boundless praise and endless discussion. Every one wondered who
could have written the clever story, which was usually attributed to
a society man. The great Dr. Johnson was enthusiastic, insisted
upon knowing the author, and soon grew very fond of his little
Fanny. He introduced her to his friends, and she became the
celebrity of a delightful circle. Sir Joshua Reynolds and Burke sat
up all night to finish 'Evelina.' The Thrales, Madame Delaney,&mdash;who
later introduced her at court,&mdash;Sheridan, Gibbon, and Sir
Walter Scott, were among those who admired her most cordially.</p>

<p>It was a happy time for Fanny, encouraged to believe her talent
far greater than it was. She wrote a drama which was read in solemn
judgment by her father and "Daddy Crisp," who decided against
it as too like 'Les PrÃ©cieuses Ridicules,' a play she had never read.
A second novel, 'Cecilia,' appeared in 1782, and was as successful as
its predecessor. Later readers find it less spontaneous, and after it
she never resumed her early style except in her journal and correspondence.
Her ambition was fully astir. She had every incentive
from her family and friends. But the old zest in composition had
departed. The self-consciousness which had always tormented her
in society seized her now, when she was trying to cater to public
taste, and made her change her frank, free, personal expression for
a stilted artificial formality of phrase.</p>

<p>Her reputation was now at its height, and she was very happy in
her position as society favorite and pride of the father whom she
had always passionately admired, when she made the mistake of
her life. Urged by her father, she accepted a position at court as
Second Keeper of the Queen's Robes. There she spent five pleasureless
and worse than profitless years. In her 'Diary and Letters,'<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2819" name="page2819">2819</a></span>
the most readable to-day of all her works, she has told the story
of wretched discomfort, of stupidly uncongenial companionship, of
arduous tasks made worse by the selfish thoughtlessness of her superiors.
She has also given our best historical picture of that time;
the every-day life at court, the slow agony of King George's increasing
insanity. But the drudgery and mean hardships of the place, and
the depression of being separated from her family, broke down her
health; and after much opposition she was allowed to resign in 1791.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards she astonished her friends by marrying General
D'Arblay, a French officer and a gentleman, although very poor. As
the pair had an income of only one hundred pounds, this seems a
perilously rash act for a woman over forty. Fortunately the match
proved a very happy one, and the situation stimulated Madame
D'Arblay to renewed authorship. 'Camilla,' her third novel, was
sold by subscription, and was a very remunerative piece of work.
But from a critical point of view it was a failure; and being written
in a heavy pedantic style, is quite deficient in her early charm.
With the proceeds she built a modest home, Camilla Cottage. Later
the family moved to France, where her husband died and where her
only son received his early education. When he was nearly ready
for an English university she returned to England, and passed her
tranquil age among her friends until she died at eighty-eight.</p>

<p>What Fanny Burney did in all unconsciousness was to establish
fiction upon a new basis. She may be said to have created the
family novel. Fielding, Smollett, and Sterne had bequeathed their
legacy impregnated with objectionable qualities, in spite of strength
and charm; they were read rather secretly, and tabooed for women.
On the other hand, the followers of Richardson were too didactic
to be readable. Fanny Burney proved that entertaining tales, unweighted
by heavy moralizing, may be written, adapted to young and
old. Her sketches of life were witty, sincere, and vigorous, yet always
moral in tone. 'Evelina,' the work of an innocent, frank girl, could
be read by any one.</p>

<p>A still greater source of her success was her robust and abounding,
though sometimes rather broad and cheap, fun. In her time
decent novels were apt to be appallingly serious in tone, and not
infrequently stupid; humor in spite of Addison still connoted much
coarseness and obtrusive sexuality, and in fiction had to be sought
in the novels written for men only. As humor is the deadly foe to
sentimentalism and hysterics, the Richardson school were equally
averse to it on further grounds. Fanny Burney produced novels fit
for women's and family reading, yet full of humor of a masculine
vigor&mdash;and it must be added, with something of masculine unsensitiveness.
There is little fineness to most of it; some is mere horse<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2820" name="page2820">2820</a></span>play,
some is extravagant farce: but it is deep and genuine, it supplied
an exigent want, and deserved its welcome. De Morgan says it was
like introducing dresses of glaring red and yellow and other crude
colors into a country where every one had previously dressed in
drab&mdash;a great relief, but not art. This is hard measure, however:
some of her character-drawing is almost as richly humorous and
valid as Jane Austen's own.</p>

<p>Fanny Burney undoubtedly did much to augment the new respect
for woman's intellectual ability, and was a stimulus to the brilliant
group which succeeded her. Miss Ferrier, Maria Edgeworth, and
Jane Austen all owe her something of their inspiration and more of
their welcome.</p>

<h3><a name="EVELINAS_LETTER_TO_THE_REV_MR_VILLARS" id="EVELINAS_LETTER_TO_THE_REV_MR_VILLARS"></a>EVELINA'S LETTER TO THE REV. MR. VILLARS</h3>

<p class="subtitle">From 'Evelina'</p>

<p class="ralign"><span class="smcap">Holborn</span>, June 17th</p>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="dcap">Yesterday</span> Mr. Smith carried his point of making a party for
Vauxhall, consisting of Madame Duval, M. Du Bois, all the
Branghtons, Mr. Brown, himself,&mdash;and me!&mdash;for I find all
endeavors vain to escape anything which these people desire I
should not.</p>

<p>There were twenty disputes previous to our setting out; first
as to the <i>time</i> of our going: Mr. Branghton, his son, and young
Brown, were for six o'clock, and all the ladies and Mr. Smith
were for eight;&mdash;the latter, however, conquered. Then as to the
<i>way</i> we should go: some were for a boat, others for a coach, and
Mr. Branghton himself was for walking; but the boat at length
was decided upon. Indeed, this was the only part of the expedition
that was agreeable to me; for the Thames was delightfully
pleasant.</p>

<p>The garden is very pretty, but too formal; I should have
been better pleased had it consisted less of straight walks, where</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Grove nods at grove, each alley has its brother."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The trees, the numerous lights, and the company in the circle
round the orchestra make a most brilliant and gay appearance;
and had I been with a party less disagreeable to me, I should
have thought it a place formed for animation and pleasure.
There was a concert, in the course of which a hautbois concerto<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2821" name="page2821">2821</a></span>
was so charmingly played that I could have thought myself
upon enchanted ground, had I had spirits more gentle to associate
with. The hautbois in the open air is heavenly.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith endeavored to attach himself to me, with such
officious assiduity and impertinent freedom that he quite sickened
me. Indeed, M. Du Bois was the only man of the party to
whom, voluntarily, I ever addressed myself. He is civil and
respectful, and I have found nobody else so since I left Howard
Grove. His English is very bad; but I prefer it to speaking
French myself, which I dare not venture to do. I converse with
him frequently, both to disengage myself from others and to
oblige Madame Duval, who is always pleased when he is attended
to.</p>

<p>As we were walking about the orchestra, I heard a bell ring;
and in a moment Mr. Smith, flying up to me, caught my hand,
and with a motion too quick to be resisted, ran away with me
many yards before I had breath to ask his meaning; though I
struggled as well as I could to get from him. At last, however,
I insisted upon stopping. "Stopping, ma'am!" cried he, "why,
we must run on, or we shall lose the cascade!"</p>

<p>And then again he hurried me away, mixing with a crowd
of people, all running with so much velocity that I could not
imagine what had raised such an alarm. We were soon followed
by the rest of the party; and my surprise and ignorance proved
a source of diversion to them all which was not exhausted the
whole evening. Young Branghton, in particular, laughed till he
could hardly stand.</p>

<p>The scene of the cascade I thought extremely pretty, and the
general effect striking and lively.</p>

<p>But this was not the only surprise which was to divert them
at my expense; for they led me about the garden purposely to
enjoy my first sight of various other deceptions.</p>

<p>About ten o'clock, Mr. Smith having chosen a <i>box</i> in a very
conspicuous place, we all went to supper. Much fault was found
with everything that was ordered, though not a morsel of anything
was left, and the dearness of the provisions, with conjectures
upon what profit was made by them, supplied discourse
during the whole meal.</p>

<p>When wine and cyder were brought, Mr. Smith said, "Now
let's enjoy ourselves; now is the time, or never. Well, ma'am,
and how do you like Vauxhall?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page2822" name="page2822">2822</a></span>
"Like it!" cried young Branghton; "why, how can she help
liking it? She has never seen such a place before, that I'll
answer for."</p>

<p>"For my part," said Miss Branghton, "I like it because it is
not vulgar."</p>

<p>"This must have been a fine treat for you, Miss," said Mr.
Branghton; "why, I suppose you was never so happy in all your
life before?"</p>

<p>I endeavored to express my satisfaction with some pleasure;
yet I believe they were much amazed at my coldness.</p>

<p>"Miss ought to stay in town till the last night," said young
Branghton; "and then, it's my belief, she'd say something to it!
Why, Lord, it's the best night of any; there's always a riot,&mdash;and
there the folks run about,&mdash;and then there's such squealing
and squalling!&mdash;and there, all the lamps are broke,&mdash;and the
women run skimper-scamper&mdash;I declare, I would not take five
guineas to miss the last night!"</p>

<p>I was very glad when they all grew tired of sitting, and
called for the waiter to pay the bill. The Miss Branghtons said
they would walk on while the gentlemen settled the account, and
asked me to accompany them; which however I declined.</p>

<p>"You girls may do as you please," said Madame Duval, "but
as to me, I promise you, I sha'n't go nowhere without the gentlemen."</p>

<p>"No more, I suppose, will my <i>cousin</i>," said Miss Branghton,
looking reproachfully towards Mr. Smith.</p>

<p>This reflection, which I feared would flatter his vanity, made
me most unfortunately request Madame Duval's permission to
attend them. She granted it; and away we went, having promised
to meet in the room.</p>

<p>To the room, therefore, I would immediately have gone: but
the sisters agreed that they would first have a <i>little pleasure</i>;
and they tittered and talked so loud that they attracted universal
notice.</p>

<p>"Lord, Polly," said the eldest, "suppose we were to take a
turn in the dark walks?"</p>

<p>"Ay, do," answered she; "and then we'll hide ourselves, and
then Mr. Brown will think we are lost."</p>

<p>I remonstrated very warmly against this plan, telling them it
would endanger our missing the rest of the party all the evening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page2823" name="page2823">2823</a></span>
"O dear," cried Miss Branghton, "I thought how uneasy Miss
would be, without a beau!"</p>

<p>This impertinence I did not think worth answering; and quite
by compulsion I followed them down a long alley, in which
there was hardly any light.</p>

<p>By the time we came near the end, a large party of gentlemen,
apparently very riotous, and who were hallooing, leaning
on one another, and laughing immoderately, seemed to rush suddenly
from behind some trees, and meeting us face to face, put
their arms at their sides and formed a kind of circle, which first
stopped our proceeding and then our retreating, for we were
presently entirely enclosed. The Miss Branghtons screamed
aloud, and I was frightened exceedingly; our screams were
answered with bursts of laughter, and for some minutes we were
kept prisoners, till at last one of them, rudely seizing hold of
me, said I was a pretty little creature.</p>

<p>Terrified to death, I struggled with such vehemence to disengage
myself from him that I succeeded, in spite of his efforts
to detain me: and immediately, and with a swiftness which fear
only could have given me, I flew rather than ran up the walk,
hoping to secure my safety by returning to the lights and company
we had so foolishly left; but before I could possibly accomplish
my purpose, I was met by another party of men, one of
whom placed himself directly in my way, calling out, "Whither
so fast, my love?"&mdash;so that I could only have proceeded by
running into his arms.</p>

<p>In a moment both my hands, by different persons, were caught
hold of, and one of them, in a most familiar manner, desired
when I ran next to accompany me in a race; while the rest of
the party stood still and laughed. I was almost distracted with
terror, and so breathless with running that I could not speak;
till another, advancing, said I was as handsome as an angel,
and desired to be of the party. I then just articulated, "For
Heaven's sake, gentlemen, let me pass!"</p>

<p>Another, then rushing suddenly forward, exclaimed, "Heaven
and earth! what voice is that?"</p>

<p>"The voice of the prettiest little actress I have seen this age,"
answered one of my persecutors.</p>

<p>"No,&mdash;no,&mdash;no,&mdash;" I <i>panted</i> out, "I am no actress&mdash;pray let
me go,&mdash;pray let me pass&mdash;"</p>

<p>"By all that's sacred," cried the same voice, which I then
knew for Sir Clement Willoughby's, "'tis herself!"</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page2824" name="page2824">2824</a></span></p>
<h3><a name="A_MAN_OF_THE_TON" id="A_MAN_OF_THE_TON"></a>A MAN OF THE TON</h3>

<p class="subtitle">From 'Cecilia'</p>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="dcap">At the</span> door of the Pantheon they were joined by Mr. Arnott
and Sir Robert Floyer, whom Cecilia now saw with added
aversion; they entered the great room during the second
act of the concert, to which, as no one of the party but herself
had any desire to listen, no sort of attention was paid; the ladies
entertaining themselves as if no orchestra was in the room, and
the gentlemen, with an equal disregard to it, struggling for a
place by the fire, about which they continued hovering till the
music was over.</p>

<p>Soon after they were seated, Mr. Meadows, sauntering towards
them, whispered something to Mrs. Mears, who, immediately
rising, introduced him to Cecilia; after which, the place
next to her being vacant, he cast himself upon it, and lolling as
much at his ease as his situation would permit, began something
like a conversation with her.</p>

<p>"Have you been long in town, ma'am?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"This is not your first winter?"</p>

<p>"Of being in town, it is."</p>

<p>"Then you have something new to see; oh charming! how I
envy you!&mdash;Are you pleased with the Pantheon?"</p>

<p>"Very much; I have seen no building at all equal to it."</p>

<p>"You have not been abroad. Traveling is the ruin of all
happiness! There's no looking at a building here after seeing
Italy."</p>

<p>"Does all happiness, then, depend upon sight of buildings?"
said Cecilia, when, turning towards her companion, she perceived
him yawning, with such evident inattention to her answer that,
not choosing to interrupt his reverie, she turned her head another
way.</p>

<p>For some minutes he took no notice of this; and then, as if
suddenly recollecting himself, he called out hastily, "I beg your
pardon, ma'am, you were saying something?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; nothing worth repeating."</p>

<p>"Oh, pray don't punish me so severely as not to let me hear
it!"</p>

<p>Cecilia, though merely not to seem offended at his negligence,
was then beginning an answer, when looking at him as she<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2825" name="page2825">2825</a></span>
spoke, she perceived that he was biting his nails with so absent
an air that he appeared not to know he had asked any question.
She therefore broke off, and left him to his cogitation.</p>

<p>Some time after, he addressed her again, saying, "Don't you
find this place extremely tiresome, ma'am?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said she half laughing, "it is indeed not very
entertaining!"</p>

<p>"Nothing is entertaining," answered he, "for two minutes
together. Things are so little different one from another, that
there is no making pleasure out of anything. We go the same
dull round forever; nothing new, no variety! all the same thing
over again! Are you fond of public places, ma'am?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, <i>soberly</i>, as Lady Grace says."</p>

<p>"Then I envy you extremely, for you have some amusement
always in your own power. How desirable that is!"</p>

<p>"And have you not the same resources?"</p>

<p>"Oh no! I am tired to death! tired of everything! I would
give the universe for a disposition less difficult to please. Yet,
after all, what is there to give pleasure? When one has seen
one thing, one has seen everything. Oh, 'tis heavy work! Don't
you find it so, ma'am?"</p>

<p>This speech was ended with so violent a fit of yawning that
Cecilia would not trouble herself to answer it: but her silence
as before passed unnoticed, exciting neither question nor comment.</p>

<p>A long pause now succeeded, which he broke at last by saying,
as he writhed himself about upon his seat, "These forms
would be much more agreeable if there were backs to them.
'Tis intolerable to be forced to sit like a schoolboy. The first
study of life is ease. There is indeed no other study that pays
the trouble of attainment. Don't you think so, ma'am?"</p>

<p>"But may not even that," said Cecilia, "by so much study
become labor?"</p>

<p>"I am vastly happy you think so."</p>

<p>"Sir?"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, ma'am, but I thought you said&mdash;I really
beg your pardon, but I was thinking of something else."</p>

<p>"You did very right, sir," said Cecilia, laughing, "for what I
said by no means merited any attention."</p>

<p>"Will you do me the favor to repeat it?" cried he, taking out
his glass to examine some lady at a distance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page2826" name="page2826">2826</a></span>
"Oh no," said Cecilia, "that would be trying your patience
too severely."</p>

<p>"These glasses shew one nothing but defects," said he; "I am
sorry they were ever invented. They are the ruin of all beauty;
no complexion can stand them. I believe that solo will never be
over! I hate a solo; it sinks, it depresses me intolerably."</p>

<p>"You will presently, sir," said Cecilia, looking at the bill of
the concert, "have a full piece; and that I hope will revive
you."</p>

<p>"A full piece! oh, insupportable! it stuns, it fatigues, it overpowers
me beyond endurance! no taste in it, no delicacy, no room
for the smallest feeling."</p>

<p>"Perhaps, then, you are only fond of singing?"</p>

<p>"I should be, if I could hear it; but we are now so miserably
off in voices, that I hardly ever attempt to listen to a song, without
fancying myself deaf from the feebleness of the performers.
I hate everything that requires attention. Nothing gives pleasure
that does not force its own way."</p>

<p>"You only, then, like loud voices, and great powers?"</p>

<p>"Oh, worse and worse!&mdash;no, nothing is so disgusting to me.
All my amazement is that these people think it worth while to
give concerts at all&mdash;one is sick to death of music."</p>

<p>"Nay," cried Cecilia, "if it gives no pleasure, at least it takes
none away; for, far from being any impediment to conversation,
I think everybody talks more during the performance than between
the acts. And what is there better you could substitute
in its place?"</p>

<p>Cecilia, receiving no answer to this question, again looked
round to see if she had been heard; when she observed her new
acquaintance, with a very thoughtful air, had turned from her to
fix his eyes upon the statue of Britannia.</p>

<p>Very soon after, he hastily arose, and seeming entirely to
forget that he had spoken to her, very abruptly walked away.</p>

<p>Mr. Gosport, who was advancing to Cecilia and had watched
part of this scene, stopped him as he was retreating, and said,
"Why, Meadows, how's this? are you caught at last?"</p>

<p>"Oh, worn to death! worn to a thread!" cried he, stretching
himself and yawning; "I have been talking with a young lady
to entertain her! oh, such heavy work! I would not go through
it again for millions!"</p>

<p>"What, have you talked yourself out of breath?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page2827" name="page2827">2827</a></span>
"No; but the effort! the effort!&mdash;Oh, it has unhinged me for
a fortnight!&mdash;Entertaining a young lady!&mdash;one had better be a
galley-slave at once!"</p>

<p>"Well, but did she not pay your toils? She is surely a sweet
creature."</p>

<p>"Nothing can pay one for such insufferable exertion! though
she's well enough, too&mdash;better than the common run&mdash;but shy,
quite too shy; no drawing her out."</p>

<p>"I thought that was to your taste. You commonly hate
much volubility. How have I heard you bemoan yourself when
attacked by Miss Larolles!"</p>

<p>"Larolles! Oh, distraction! she talks me into a fever in two
minutes. But so it is for ever! nothing but extremes to be met
with! common girls are too forward, this lady is too reserved&mdash;always
some fault! always some drawback! nothing ever perfect!"</p>

<p>"Nay, nay," cried Mr. Gosport, "you do not know her; she
is perfect enough, in all conscience."</p>

<p>"Better not know her then," answered he, again yawning,
"for she cannot be pleasing. Nothing perfect is natural,&mdash;I hate
everything out of nature."</p>

<h3><a name="MISS_BURNEYS_FRIENDS" id="MISS_BURNEYS_FRIENDS"></a>MISS BURNEY'S FRIENDS</h3>

<p class="subtitle">From the 'Letters'</p>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="dcap">But</span> Dr. Johnson's approbation!&mdash;it almost crazed me with
agreeable surprise&mdash;it gave me such a flight of spirits that
I danced a jig to Mr. Crisp, without any preparation,
music, or explanation&mdash;to his no small amazement and diversion.
I left him, however, to make his own comments upon my
friskiness, without affording him the smallest assistance.</p>

<p>Susan also writes me word that when my father went last to
Streatham, Dr. Johnson was not there, but Mrs. Thrale told him
that when he gave her the first volume of 'Evelina,' which she
had lent him, he said, "Why, madam, why, what a charming
book you lent me!" and eagerly inquired for the rest. He was
particularly pleased with the snow-hill scenes, and said that
Mr. Smith's vulgar gentility was admirably portrayed; and when
Sir Clement joins them, he said there was a shade of character
prodigiously well marked. Well may it be said, that the greatest
minds are ever the most candid to the inferior set! I think I<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2828" name="page2828">2828</a></span>
should love Dr. Johnson for such lenity to a poor mere worm
in literature, even if I were not myself the identical grub he has
obliged.</p>

<p>Susan has sent me a little note which has really been less
pleasant to me, because it has alarmed me for my future concealment.
It is from Mrs. Williams, an exceeding pretty poetess,
who has the misfortune to be blind, but who has, to make some
amends, the honor of residing in the house of Dr. Johnson; for
though he lives almost wholly at Streatham, he always keeps his
apartments in town, and this lady acts as mistress of his house.</p>

<blockquote><p class="ralign smcap">July 25.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Williams sends compliments to Dr. Burney, and begs he
will intercede with Miss Burney to do her the favor to lend her the
reading of 'Evelina.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>Though I am frightened at this affair, I am by no means
insensible to the honor which I receive from the certainty that
Dr. Johnson must have spoken very well of the book, to have
induced Mrs. Williams to send to our house for it.</p>

<p>I now come to last Saturday evening, when my beloved
father came to Chesington, in full health, charming spirits, and
all kindness, openness, and entertainment.</p>

<p>In his way hither he had stopped at Streatham, and he settled
with Mrs. Thrale that he would call on her again in his way to
town, and carry me with him! and Mrs. Thrale said, "We all
long to know her."</p>

<p>I have been in a kind of twitter ever since, for there seems
something very formidable in the idea of appearing as an authoress!
I ever dreaded it, as it is a title which must raise more
expectations than I have any chance of answering. Yet I am
highly flattered by her invitation, and highly delighted in the
prospect of being introduced to the Streatham society.</p>

<p>She sent me some very serious advice to write for the theatre,
as she says I so naturally run into conversations that 'Evelina'
absolutely and plainly points out that path to me; and she hinted
how much she should be pleased to be "honored with my confidence."</p>

<p>My dear father communicated this intelligence, and a great
deal more, with a pleasure that almost surpassed that with which
I heard it, and he seems quite eager for me to make another<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2829" name="page2829">2829</a></span>
attempt. He desired to take upon himself the communication
to my Daddy Crisp; and as it is now in so many hands that
it is possible accident might discover it to him, I readily consented.</p>

<p>Sunday evening, as I was going into my father's room,
I heard him say, "The variety of characters&mdash;the variety of
scenes&mdash;and the language&mdash;why, she has had very little education
but what she has given herself&mdash;less than any of the others!"
and Mr. Crisp exclaimed, "Wonderful!&mdash;it's wonderful!"</p>

<p>I now found what was going forward, and therefore deemed
it most fitting to decamp.</p>

<p>About an hour after, as I was passing through the hall, I met
my daddy [Crisp]. His face was all animation and archness; he
doubled his fist at me and would have stopped me, but I ran
past him into the parlor.</p>

<p>Before supper, however, I again met him, and he would not
suffer me to escape; he caught both my hands and looked as if
he would have looked me through, and then exclaimed, "Why,
you little hussy&mdash;you young devil!&mdash;ain't you ashamed to look
me in the face, you <i>Evelina</i>, you! Why, what a dance have you
led me about it! Young friend, indeed! O you little hussy,
what tricks have you served me!"</p>

<p>I was obliged to allow of his running on with these gentle
appellations for I know not how long, ere he could sufficiently
compose himself, after his great surprise, to ask or hear any particulars;
and then he broke out every three instants with exclamations
of astonishment at how I had found time to write so
much unsuspected, and how and where I had picked up such
various materials; and not a few times did he with me, as he
had with my father, exclaim "Wonderful!"</p>

<p>He has since made me read him all my letters upon this subject.
He said Lowndes would have made an estate had he given
me Â£1000 for it, and that he ought not to have given less!
"You have nothing to do now," continued he, "but to take your
pen in hand; for your fame and reputation are made, and any
bookseller will snap at what you write."</p>

<p>I then told him that I could not but really and unaffectedly
regret that the affair was spread to Mrs. Williams and her
friends.</p>

<p>"Pho," said he: "if those who are proper judges think it right
that it should be known, why should you trouble yourself about<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2830" name="page2830">2830</a></span>
it? You have not spread it, there can no imputation of vanity
fall to your share, and it cannot come out more to your honor
than through such a channel as Mrs. Thrale."</p>

<hr class="invis" />

<p><span class="smcap">London, August</span>.&mdash;I have now to write an account of the
most consequential day I have spent since my birth; namely, my
Streatham visit.</p>

<p>Our journey to Streatham was the least pleasant part of the
day, for the roads were dreadfully dusty, and I was really in the
fidgets from thinking what my reception might be, and from
fearing they would expect a less awkward and backward kind of
person than I was sure they would find.</p>

<p>Mr. Thrale's house is white, and very pleasantly situated in a
fine paddock. Mrs. Thrale was strolling about, and came to us
as we got out of the chaise.</p>

<p>She then received me, taking both my hands, and with mixed
politeness and cordiality welcoming me to Streatham. She led
me into the house, and addressed herself almost wholly for a few
minutes to my father, as if to give me an assurance she did not
mean to regard me as a show, or to distress or frighten me by
drawing me out. Afterwards she took me up stairs, and showed
me the house, and said she had very much wished to see me at
Streatham; and should always think herself much obliged to Dr.
Burney for his goodness in bringing me, which she looked upon
as a very great favor.</p>

<p>But though we were some time together, and though she was
so very civil, she did not <i>hint</i> at my book, and I love her much
more than ever for her delicacy in avoiding a subject which she
could not but see would have greatly embarrassed me.</p>

<p>When we returned to the music-room, we found Miss Thrale
was with my father. Miss Thrale is a very fine girl, about fourteen
years of age, but cold and reserved, though full of knowledge
and intelligence.</p>

<p>Soon after, Mrs. Thrale took me to the library; she talked a
little while upon common topics, and then at last she mentioned
'Evelina.'</p>

<p>"Yesterday at supper," said she, "we talked it all over, and
discussed all your characters; but Dr. Johnson's favorite is Mr.
Smith. He declares the fine gentleman <i>manquÃ©</i> was never better
drawn, and he acted him all the evening, saying 'he was all for
the ladies!' He repeated whole scenes by heart. I declare I<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2831" name="page2831">2831</a></span>
was astonished at him. Oh, you can't imagine how much he
is pleased with the book; he 'could not get rid of the rogue,'
he told me. But was it not droll," said she, "that I should
recommend it to Dr. Burney? and tease him so innocently to
read it?"</p>

<p>I now prevailed upon Mrs. Thrale to let me amuse myself,
and she went to dress. I then prowled about to choose some
book, and I saw upon the reading-table 'Evelina.' I had just
fixed upon a new translation of Cicero's LÃ¦lius, when the library
door was opened, and Mr. Seward entered. I instantly put away
my book because I dreaded being thought studious and affected.
He offered his services to find anything for me, and then in the
same breath ran on to speak of the book with which I had myself
"favored the world"!</p>

<p>The exact words he began with I cannot recollect, for I was
actually confounded by the attack; and his abrupt manner of
letting me know he was <i>au fait</i> equally astonished and provoked
me. How different from the delicacy of Mr. and Mrs. Thrale!</p>

<p>When we were summoned to dinner, Mrs. Thrale made my
father and me sit on each side of her. I said that I hoped I
did not take Dr. Johnson's place;&mdash;for he had not yet appeared.</p>

<p>"No," answered Mrs. Thrale, "he will sit by you, which I am
sure will give him great pleasure."</p>

<p>Soon after we were seated, this great man entered. I have
so true a veneration for him, that the very sight of him inspires
me with delight and reverence, notwithstanding the cruel infirmities
to which he is subject; for he has almost perpetual convulsive
movements, either of his hands, lips, feet, or knees, and
sometimes of all together.</p>

<p>Mrs. Thrale introduced me to him, and he took his place.
We had a noble dinner, and a most elegant dessert. Dr. Johnson,
in the middle of dinner, asked Mrs. Thrale what was in
some little pies that were near him.</p>

<p>"Mutton," answered she, "so I don't ask you to eat any,
because I know you despise it!"</p>

<p>"No, madam, no," cried he; "I despise nothing that is good
of its sort; but I am too proud now to eat of it. Sitting by
Miss Burney makes me very proud to-day!"</p>

<p>"Miss Burney," said Mrs. Thrale, laughing, "you must take
great care of your heart if Dr. Johnson attacks it; for I assure
you he is not often successless."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page2832" name="page2832">2832</a></span>
"What's that you say, madam?" cried he; "are you making
mischief between the young lady and me already?"</p>

<p>A little while after he drank Miss Thrale's health and mine,
and then added:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Tis a terrible thing that we cannot wish young ladies well
without wishing them to become old women!"</p>

<p>"But some people," said Mr. Seward, "are old and young at
the same time, for they wear so well that they never look old."</p>

<p>"No, sir, no," cried the doctor, laughing; "that never yet
was: you might as well say they are at the same time tall and
short."</p>

<p class="cap_1"><span class="dcap">There</span> have been, there are, and there always will be, poets
concerning whose lives it is not necessary that the world
should know anything in order to understand their poetry;
and there have been, there are, and there always will be, other poets
concerning whose lives it is necessary that the world should know all
there is to be known, before it can begin to understand their poetry.
The difference between these two classes of poets is the difference
between a company of accomplished actors, who by virtue of their
training and practice are able to project themselves into imaginary
characters on the public stage, and the originals of these characters
in private personal life; or to put it in other words, the difference
between art and nature. It is the privilege of art to dispense with
explanations and extenuations; for if it be true to itself it is sufficient
in itself, and anything added to it or taken from it is an impertinence
or a deformity. When we read 'Hamlet' and 'Lear,' or
'As You Like It' and 'Much Ado About Nothing,' we do not ask
ourselves what Shakespeare meant by them,&mdash;why some scenes were
written in verse and other scenes in prose,&mdash;for it is not of Shakespeare
that we are thinking as we read, but of his characters, for
whom we feel that he is no more responsible than we are, since they
move, live, and have their being in a world of their own, above the
smoke and stir of this dim spot which men call Earth,&mdash;the world of
pure, perfect, poetic art. If Shakespeare was conscious of himself
when he wrote, he succeeded in concealing himself so thoroughly
that it is impossible to discover him in his writing,&mdash;as impossible
as it is not to discover other poets in their writings; for whatever
is absent from the choir of British song, the note of personality is
always present there. A low laugh in the gracious mouth of Chaucer,
a harsh rebuke on the stern lips of Milton, a modish sneer in
the smile of Pope,&mdash;it was now a stifled complaint, now an amorous
ditty, and now a riotous shout with Burns, who was as much a poet
through his personality as through his genius. He put his life into
his song; and not to know what his life was, is not to know what his
song is,&mdash;why it was a consolation to him while he lived, and why
after his death it made <span class="nowrap">his&mdash;</span></p></div>

<span class="i0">"One of the few, the immortal names,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That were not born to die."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Early in the last half of the eighteenth century a staid and
worthy man, named William Burness (as the name Burns was then
spelled), a native of Kincardineshire, emigrated to Ayrshire in
pursuit of a livelihood. He hired himself as a gardener to the laird
of Fairlie, and later to a Mr. Crawford of Doonside, and at length
took a lease of seven acres of land on his own account at Alloway
on the banks of the Doon. He built a clay cottage there with his
own hands, and to this little cottage, in December 1757, he brought a
wife, the eldest daughter of a farmer of Carrick. There was a disparity
in their ages, for he was about thirty-six and she some eight
or nine years younger; and a disparity in their education, for he was
an intelligent reader and lover of books, while she, though she had
been taught as a child to read the Bible and to repeat the Psalms,
was not able to write her name. She had a great respect for her
husband, whose occupation was now that of a nurseryman. A little
more than a year after their marriage, on the 25th of January, 1759,
she bore him a son who was christened Robert, who was followed, as
time went on, by brothers and sisters; and before many years were
over, what with the guidman, the guidwife, and the bonny bairns,
there was not much spare room in the little clay biggin at Alloway.</p>

<p>Poor as they were, the social condition of this Scottish family was
superior to the social condition of most English families in the same
walk of rustic life; this superiority resulting from certain virtues
inherent in the national character,&mdash;the virtues of simple appetites
and frugal habits, of patience and courage in adversity, and best of all,
in affectionate hearts, reverential minds, and a thirst for knowledge
which only books could supply. William Burness inherited respect
for education from his father, who in his young manhood was instrumental
in building a schoolhouse on his farm at Clockenhill. Accordingly,
when his son Robert was in his sixth year he sent him to a
little school at Alloway Mill, about a mile from his cottage; and not
long after he took the lead in hiring a young teacher named Murdoch
to instruct him and his younger brother Gilbert at some place
near at hand. Their school-books consisted of the Shorter Catechism,
the Bible, the spelling-book, and Fisher's 'English Grammar.' Robert
was a better scholar than Gilbert, especially in grammar, in which
he acquired some proficiency. The only book which he is known to
have read outside of his primitive curriculum was a 'Life of Hannibal,'
which was loaned him by his teacher. When he was seven the
family removed to a small upland farm called Mount Oliphant, about
two miles from Alloway, to and from which the boys plodded daily<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2835" name="page2835">2835</a></span>
in pursuit of learning. At the end of two years the teacher obtained
a better situation in Carrick; the school was broken up, and from
that time onward William Burness took upon himself the education
of his lads and lassies, whom he treated as if they were men and
women, conversing with them on serious topics as they accompanied
him in his labors on the farm, and borrowing for their edification,
from a Book Society in Ayr, solid works like Derham's 'Physico- and
Astro-Theology' and Ray's 'Wisdom of God in the Creation.' This
course of heavy reading was lightened by the 'History of Sir William
Wallace,' which was loaned to Robert by a blacksmith named Kilpatrick,
and which forced a hot flood of Scottish feeling through his
boyish veins. His next literary benefactor was a brother of his
mother, who while living for a time with the family had learned
some arithmetic by their winter evening's candle. He went one day
into a bookseller's shop in Ayr to purchase a Ready Reckoner and a
Complete Letter-Writer, but procured by mistake in place of the
latter a small collection of 'Letters by Eminent Wits,' which proved
of more advantage (or disadvantage) to his nephew than to himself,
for it inspired the lad with a desire to excel in epistolary writing.
Not long after this Robert's early tutor Murdoch returned to Ayr,
and lent him Pope's Works; a bookish friend of his father's obtained
for him the reading of two volumes of Richardson's 'Pamela' and
another friendly soul the reading of Smollett's 'Ferdinand Count
Fathom,' and 'Peregrine Pickle.' The book which most delighted
him, however, was a collection of English songs called 'The Lark.'</p>

<p class="caption">ROBERT BURNS.</p>
</div>

<p>Mount Oliphant taxed the industry and endurance of William
Burness to the utmost; and what with the sterility of the soil, which
was the poorest in the parish, and the loss of cattle by accidents
and disease, it was with great difficulty that he managed to support
his family. They lived so sparingly that butcher's meat was for
years a stranger in the house, and they labored, children and all,
from morning to night. Robert, at the age of thirteen, assisted in
threshing the crop of corn, and at fifteen he was the principal
laborer on the farm, for they could not afford a hired hand. That
he was constantly afflicted with a dull headache in the evenings was
not to be wondered at; nor that the sight and thought of his gray-haired
father, who was turned fifty, should depress his spirits and
impart a tinge of gloom to his musings. It was under circumstances
like these that he composed his first song, the inspiration of which
was a daughter of the blacksmith who had loaned him the 'History
of Sir William Wallace.' It was the custom of the country to couple
a man and woman together in the labors of harvest; and on this
occasion his partner was Nelly Kilpatrick, with whom, boy-like,&mdash;for
he was in his seventeenth year and she a year younger,&mdash;he liked<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2836" name="page2836">2836</a></span>
to lurk behind the rest of the hands when they returned from their
labors in the evening, and who made his pulse beat furiously when
he fingered over her little hand to pick out the cruel nettle-stings
and thistles. She sang sweetly, and among her songs there was
one which was said to be composed by a small laird's son about
one of his father's maids, with whom he was in love; and Robert
saw no reason why he should not rhyme as well as he, for the
author had no more school-craft than himself. Writing of this song
a few years later, he called it puerile and silly; and his verdict as
a poetical one was correct. Still, considered as a song, this artless
effusion possessed one merit of which he himself was probably not
conscious: it was inspired by his feeling and not by his reading, by
the warmth and purity of his love of Nelly Kilpatrick, and not by
his admiration of any amorous ditty in his collection of English
songs. It was a poor thing, but it was certainly his own, and
nowhere more so than in its recognition of the womanly personality
of its heroine:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And then there's something in her gait<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Gars ony dress look weel."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This touch of nature, which no modish artist would have attempted,
marked the hand of one who painted from the life.</p>

<p>William Burness struggled along for twelve years at Mount Oliphant,
and then removed to Lochlea, in the parish of Tarbolton.
Here he rented a larger farm, the soil of which promised a surer
maintenance for himself and the hostages he had given to Fortune.
And there these loving hostages began to put away childish things,
and to become men and women. They were cheerful, in spite of the
frugality which their poverty imposed upon them; and were merry
in their simple homely way, singing and dancing among themselves
and among their friendly neighbors. Their hearts expanded in the
healthy air about them, particularly the heart of Robert, which
turned to thoughts of love,&mdash;not lightly, as in his boyish fancy for
Nelly Kilpatrick, but seriously, as beseemed a man; for he was now
in his nineteenth year, and as conscious of what he was to woman as
of what woman was to him. A born lover, and a born poet, he discovered
himself and his song at Tarbolton. The custom of the country
and the time sanctioned a freedom of manners, and a frequency
of meeting on the part of rustic amorists, of which he was not slow
to avail himself. The love affairs of the Scottish peasantry are thus
described by one of his biographers:&mdash;"The young farmer or plowman,
after his day of exhausting toil, would proceed to the home
of his mistress, one, two, three, or more miles distant, there signal
her to the door, and then the pair would seat themselves in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2837" name="page2837">2837</a></span>
barn for an hour or two's conversation." Burns practiced this mode
of courtship, which was the only one open to him, and among the
only women whom he knew at Tarbolton. "He made no distinction
between the farmer's own daughters and those who acted as his
servants, the fact after all being that the servants were often themselves
the daughters of farmers, and only sent to be the hirelings of
others because their services were not needed at home." We should
remember this habit of the Scottish peasantry if we wish to understand
the early songs of Burns; for they were suggested by it, and
vitalized by it, as much as by his impassioned genius. He painted
what he saw; he sang what he felt. We have a glimpse of him in
one of his winter courtships in 'My Nanie, O'; another and warmer
glimpse of him in one of his summer courtships in 'The Rigs o' Barley';
and another and livelier glimpse of him in one of his mocking
moods in 'Tibbie, I hae seen the day.' But he was more than the
lover which these songs revealed: he was a man of sound understanding
and fine, active intelligence, gifted with ready humor and
a keen sense of wit. If he had been other than he was, he might
and probably would have been elated by his poetic powers, of which
he must have been aware; but being what he was, he was content
to enjoy them and to exercise them modestly, and at such scanty
intervals as his daily duties afforded. He composed his songs as he
went about his work, plowing, sowing, reaping; crooning them as
he strode along the fields, and correcting them in his head as the
hours dragged on, until night came, and he could write them down
in his little room by the light of his solitary candle. He had no illusions
about himself: he was the son of a poor farmer, who, do what
he might, was never prosperous; and poverty was his portion. His
apprehension, which was justified by the misfortunes of the family
at Mount Oliphant, was confirmed by their dark continuance at Tarbolton,
where he saw his honored father, bowed with years of toil,
grow older and feebler day by day, dying of consumption before
his eyes. The end came on February 13th, 1784; and a day or two
afterwards the humble coffin of William Burness, arranged between
two leading horses placed after each other, and followed by relations
and neighbors on horseback, was borne to Alloway and buried in
the old kirkyard.</p>

<p>The funeral over, the family removed to Mossgiel, in the parish
of Mauchline, where, at Martinmas, Robert and Gilbert had rented
another farm. Having no means of their own, they and their sisters
were obliged to rank as creditors of their dead father for the arrears
of wages due them as laborers at Lochlea; and it was with these
arrears, which they succeeded in wresting from their old landlord or
his factor, that they stocked the new farm. The change was a<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2838" name="page2838">2838</a></span>
beneficial one for all the family, who were now for the first time in
their lives provided with a comfortable dwelling; and everything considered,
especially so for their head,&mdash;which Robert, who was now
in his twenty-sixth year, virtually became. He realized the gravity of
the responsibility which rested upon him, and rightly judging that
industry alone would not enable him to support it, resolved to work
with the brains of others as well as his own hard hands. He read
farming books, he calculated crops, he attended markets, but all to
no purpose; for like his father before him, however much he may
have deserved success, he could not command it. What he could and
did command however was the admiration of his fellows, who were
quick to perceive and ready to acknowledge his superiority. There
was that about him which impressed them,&mdash;something in his temperament
or talent, in his personality or character, which removed
him from the roll of common men. What seemed to distinguish him
most was the charm of his conversation, which, remarkable as it was
for fluency and force, for originality and brilliancy, was quite as
remarkable for good sense and good feeling. Grave or gay, as the
occasion suggested and the spirit moved him, he spoke as with
authority and was listened to with rapt attention. His company was
sought, and go where he would he was everywhere welcomed as a
good fellow. He had the art of making friends; and though they
were not always of the kind that his well-wishers could have desired,
they were the best of their kind in and about Mauchline. What he
saw in some of them, other than the pleasure they felt in his society,
it is hard to say; but whatever it was, he liked it and the conviviality
to which it led,&mdash;which, occasionally coarsened by stories that
set the table in a roar, was ever and anon refined by songs that
filled his eyes with tears. His life was a hard one,&mdash;a succession of
dull, monotonous, laborious days, haunted by anxiety and harassed
by petty, irritating cares,&mdash;but he faced it cheerfully, manfully,
and wrestled with it triumphantly, for he compelled it to forge
the weapons with which he conquered it. He sang like a boy at
Lochlea; he wrote like a man at Mossgiel. The first poetical note
that he struck there was a personal one, and commemorative of his
regard for two rustic rhymers, David Sillar and John Lapraik, to
whom he addressed several Epistles,&mdash;a form of composition which
he found in Ferguson and Ramsay, and of which he was enamored.
That he thoroughly enjoyed the impulse which suggested and dictated
these Epistles was evident from the spirit with which they
were written. In the first of the two, which he addressed to Sillar,
he discovered and disclosed for the first time the distinctive individuality
of his genius. It was a charming and touching piece of writing;
charming as a delineation of his character, and touching as a<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2839" name="page2839">2839</a></span>
confession of his creed,&mdash;the patient philosophy of the poor. As his
social horizon was enlarged, his mental vision was sharpened; and
before long, other interests than those which concerned himself and
his poetical friends excited his sympathies and stimulated his powers.
It was a period of theological squabbles, and he plunged into them
at once, partly no doubt because there was a theological strain in his
blood, but largely because they furnished opportunities for the riotous
exercise of his wit. He paid his disrespects to the fomenters of this
holy brawl in 'The Twa Herds,' and he pilloried an old person who
was obnoxious to him, in that savage satire on sanctimonious hypocrisy,
'Holy Willy's Prayer.' Always a poet, he was more, much
more than a poet. He was a student of man,&mdash;of all sorts of men;
caring much, as a student, for the baser sort which reveled in Poosie
Nansie's dram-shop, and which he celebrated in 'The Jolly Beggars';
but caring more, as a man, for the better sort which languished
in huts where poor men lodged, and of which he was the voice of
lamentation in 'Man was Made to Mourn.' He was a student of
manners, which he painted with a sure hand, his masterpiece being
that reverential reproduction of the family life at Lochlea,&mdash;'The
Cotter's Saturday Night.' He was a student of nature,&mdash;his love of
which was conspicuous in his poetry, flushing his words with picturesque
phrases and flooding his lines with the feeling of outdoor life.
He was a student of animal life,&mdash;a lover of horses and dogs,
observant of their habits and careful of their comfort. He felt for
the little mouse which his plowshare turned out of its nest, and he
pitied the poor hare which the unskillful fowler could only wound.
The commoners of earth and air were dear to him; and the flower
beside his path, the gowan wet with dew, was precious in his eyes.
His heart was large, his mind was comprehensive, and his temper
singularly sweet and sunny.</p>

<p>Such was Robert Burns at Mossgiel, and a very likable person he
was. But all the while there was another Robert Burns at Mossgiel,
and he was not quite so likable. He had a strange fascination for
women, and a strange disregard of the consequences of this fascination.
This curious combination of contradictory traits was an unfortunate
one, as a young woman of Mauchline was destined to learn.
She was the daughter of a mason, and her name was Jean Armour.
He met her on a race day at a house of entertainment which must
have been popular, since it contained a dancing-hall, admission to
which was free, any man being privileged to invite to it any woman
whom he fancied and for whose diversion he was willing to disburse
a penny to the fiddler. He was accompanied on this occasion by his
dog, who insisted on following him into the hall and persisted in
keeping at his heels while he danced,&mdash;a proof of its fidelity which<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2840" name="page2840">2840</a></span>
created considerable amusement, and which its master turned to his
personal account by saying he wished he could get any of the lasses
to like him as well as his dog. Jean heard his remark, and not long
afterwards, as he was passing through the washing-green where she
was bleaching clothes (from which she begged him to call off his
troublesome follower), she reminded him of it by asking him if he
had yet got any of the lasses to like him as well as did his dog?
He got one there and then; for from that hour Jean was attached to
him and he to Jean. He was reticent about his conquest, concealing
it from his closest friends, and even from his dearest foe, the
Muse; but however reticent, his conquest was not to be concealed,
for Jean one day discovered that she was with child. What he felt
when this calamity was made known to him we know not, for he
kept his own counsel. What he wished his friends to feel, if they
could and would, we may divine from a poem which he wrote about
this time,&mdash;an address to the rigidly righteous, into whose minds he
sought to instill the charity of which he and Jean were sorely in
need:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Then gently scan your brother man,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Still gentler sister woman;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though they may gang a kennin' wrang<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To step aside is human:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"One point must still be greatly dark,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The moving why they do it;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And just as lamely can ye mark<br /></span>
<span class="i2">How far perhaps they rue it."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He wrote a paper which he gave Jean, in the belief that it constituted
a marriage between them,&mdash;a belief which was perhaps justifiable
in the existing condition of Scottish laws of marriage. But
he counted without his host; for instead of accepting it as a manly
endeavor to shield the reputation of his daughter and divert scandal
from his family, the hot-headed father of Jean denounced it and
demanded its destruction,&mdash;a foolish proceeding to which his foolish
daughter consented. Whether its destruction could destroy his obligation
need not be curiously considered; it is enough to know that
he believed that it did, and that it was a proof of perfidy on the
part of Jean. But they should see! She had forsaken him, and he
would forsake her. So, the old love being off, he was straightway
on with a new one. Of this new love little is known, except that she
was, or had been, a servant in the family of one of his friends,&mdash;a
nurserymaid or something of the sort,&mdash;and that she was of Highland
parentage. Her name was Mary Campbell. He transferred his
affections from Jean to Mary, and his fascination was so strong that<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2841" name="page2841">2841</a></span>
she promised to become his wife. They met one Sunday in a
sequestered spot on the banks of the Ayr, where, standing on each
side of a little brook, they laved their hands in its limpid waters,
plighted their troth, and exchanged Bibles,&mdash;she giving him her
copy, which was a small one, he giving her his copy, which was
a large one in two volumes, on the blank leaves of which he
had written his name and two quotations from the sacred text,
one being the solemn injunction to fidelity in Leviticus:&mdash;"And
ye shall not swear by my name falsely. I am the Lord." They
parted. She returned to her relatives, among whom she died a few
months afterward of a malignant fever; he returned to his troubles
at Mossgiel. They were not all of his own making. It was not his
fault that the farm was an unproductive one; he could not impart
fertility to barren acres nor compel the sun to ripen scanty crops.
In the hope of bettering his fortunes he resolved to expatriate himself,
and entered into negotiations with a man who had an estate in
the West Indies, and who agreed to employ him as his factor. He
had no money and no means of getting any, except by the publication
of his poems, none of which had yet appeared in print. He
issued a prospectus for their publication by subscription; and such
was the reputation they had made for him through their circulation
in manuscript, and the activity of his friends, that the necessary
number of subscribers was soon obtained. They were published at
Kilmarnock in the summer of 1786, and were read by all classes,&mdash;by
the plowman as eagerly as by the laird, by the milkmaid in the
dairy as eagerly as by her mistress in the parlor,&mdash;and wherever
they were read they were admired. No poet was ever so quickly
recognized as Burns, who captivated his readers by his human
quality as well as his genius. They understood him at once. He
sung of things which concerned them,&mdash;of emotions which they felt,
the joys and sorrows of their homely lives, and, singing from his
heart, his songs went to their hearts. His fame as a poet spread
along the country and came to the knowledge of Dr. Blacklock,
a blind poet in Edinburgh, who after hearing Burns's poetry was
so impressed by it that he wrote or dictated a letter about it,
which he addressed to a correspondent in Kilmarnock, by whom
it was placed in the hands of Burns. He was still at Mossgiel, and
in a perturbed condition of mind, not knowing whether he could
remain there, or whether he would have to go to Jamaica. He
resolved at last to do neither, but to go to Edinburgh, which he
accordingly did, proceeding thither on a pony borrowed from a
friend.</p>

<p>The visit of Burns to Edinburgh was a hazardous experiment from
which he might well have shrunk. He was ignorant of the manners<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2842" name="page2842">2842</a></span>
of its citizens,&mdash;the things which differentiated them as a class from
the only class he knew,&mdash;but his ignorance did not embarrass him.
He was self-possessed; manly in his bearing; modest, but not humble;
courteous, but independent. He had no letters of introduction,
and needed none, for his poetry had prepared the way for him. It
was soon known among the best people in Edinburgh that he was
there, and they hastened to make his acquaintance; one of the first
to do so being a man of rank, Lord Glencairn. To know him was
to know other men of rank, and to be admitted to the brilliant
circles in which they moved. Burns's society was sought by the
nobility and gentry and by the literary lords of the period, professors,
historians, men of letters. They dined him and wined him
and listened to him,&mdash;listened to him eagerly, for here as elsewhere
he distinguished himself by his conversation, the charm of which
was so potent that the Duchess of Gordon declared that she was
taken off her feet by it. He increased his celebrity in Edinburgh by
the publication of a new and enlarged edition of his Poems, which
he dedicated to the noblemen and gentlemen of the Caledonian Hunt
in a page of manly prose, the proud modesty and the worldly tact
of which must have delighted them. "The poetic genius of my
country found me," he wrote, "as the prophetic bard Elijah did
Elisha, and threw her inspiring mantle over me. She bade me sing
the loves, the joys, the rural scenes and rural pleasures of my native
soil in my native tongue. I tuned my wild, artless notes as she
inspired. She whispered me to come to this ancient metropolis of
Caledonia and lay my songs under your honored protection. I now
obey her dictates." His mind was not active at this time, for
beyond a few trivial verses he wrote nothing worthy of him except
a short but characteristic 'Epistle to the Guidwife of Wauchope
House.' He spent the winter of 1786 and the spring of 1787 in
Edinburgh; and summer being close at hand, he resolved to return
for a time to Mossgiel. There were strong reasons for his return,
some of which pertained to his impoverished family, whom he was
now in a condition to assist, for the new edition of his Poems had
proved profitable to himself, and others&mdash;for before his departure
for Edinburgh, Jean had borne twins, a boy and a girl; and the girl
was being cared for at Mossgiel. He returned therefore to his
family and his child, and whether he purposed to do so or not, to
the mother of his child. It was not a wise thing to do, perhaps, but
it was a human thing, and very characteristic of the man, who,
whatever else he was not, was very human. And the Armours were
very human also, for old Armour received him into his house, and
Jean received him into her arms. She was not a prudent young
woman, but she was a fond and forgiving one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page2843" name="page2843">2843</a></span>
The life of Burns during the next twelve months may be briefly
described. He returned to Edinburgh, where in his most serious
moods he held sessions of thought. It may have been a silent one,
but it was not a sweet one; for while he summoned up remembrance
of things past, he summoned up apprehensions of things to come.
That he had won distinction as a poet was certain; what was not
certain was the duration of this distinction. He was famous to-day;
he might be forgotten to-morrow. But famous or forgotten, he and
those dependent on him must have bread; and since he saw no
reasonable prospect of earning it with his head, he must earn it
with his hands. They were strong and willing. So he leased a farm
at Ellisland in Dumfriesshire, and obtained an appointment from the
Board of Excise: then, poet, farmer, and exciseman, he went back to
Mauchline and was married to Jean. Leaving her and her child he
repaired to Ellisland, where he was obliged to build a cottage for
himself. He dug the foundations, collected stone and sand, carted
lime, and generally assisted the masons and carpenters. Nor was
this all, for he directed at the same time whatever labor the careful
cultivation of a farm demanded from its tenant. He was happy at
Ellisland,&mdash;happier than he had been at Mount Oliphant, where his
family had been so sorely pinched by poverty, and much happier
than he had been at Mossgiel, where he had wrought so much
trouble for himself and others. A good son and a good brother, he
was a good husband and a good father. It was in no idle moment
that he wrote this stanza, which his conduct now illustrated:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"To make a happy fireside chime<br /></span>
<span class="i6">To weans and wife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That's the true pathos and sublime<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Of human life."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>His life was orderly; his wants were few and easily supplied; his
mind was active, and his poetical vein more productive than it had
been at Edinburgh. The best lyric that he wrote at Ellisland was
the one in praise of his wife ('Of a' the airts the wind can blaw&mdash;');
the most important poem 'Tam o' Shanter.' Farmer and exciseman,
he was very busy,&mdash;busier, perhaps, as the last than the first, for
while his farming labors might be performed by others, his excise
labors could only be performed by himself; the district under his
charge covering ten parishes, the inspection of which required his
riding about two hundred miles a week. The nature of his duties,
and the spirit with which he went through them, may be inferred
from a bit of his doggerel:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page2844" name="page2844">2844</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Searching auld wives' barrels,<br /></span>
<span class="i12">Och, hone, the day!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That clarty barm should stain my laurels:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Wad move the very hearts o' stanes!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A model exciseman, he was neither a model nor a prosperous farmer,
for here as elsewhere, mother earth was an unkind stepmother to
him. He struggled on, hoping against hope, from June 1788 to
December 1791; then, beaten, worn out, exhausted, he gave up his
farm and removed to Dumfries, exchanging his cozy cottage with its
outlook of woods and waters for a mean little house in the Wee
Vennel, with its inlook of narrow dirty streets and alleys. His life
in Dumfries was not what one could wish it might have been for his
sake; for though it was not without its hours of happiness, its unhappy
days were many, and of a darker kind than he had hitherto
encountered. They were monotonous, they were wearisome, they
were humiliating. They could not be other than humiliating to a
man of his proud, impulsive spirit, who, schooling himself to prudence
on account of his wife and children, was not always prudent in his
speech. Who indeed could be, unless he were a mean, cowardly
creature, in the storm and stress of the great Revolution with which
France was then convulsed? His utterances, whatever they may have
been, were magnified to his official and social disadvantage, and he
was greatly troubled. He felt his disfavor with the people of Dumfries,&mdash;as
he could not help showing to one of his friends, who, riding
into the town on a fine summer evening to attend a county ball, saw
him walking alone on the shady side of the principal street, while
the other side was crowded with ladies and gentlemen who seemed
unwilling to recognize him. This friend dismounted, and joining
him, proposed that they should cross the street. "Nay, nay, my
young friend," said the poet, "that's all over now." Then, after a
pause, he quoted two stanzas from a pathetic ballad by Lady Grizel
Bailie:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"His bonnet stood then fu' fair on his brow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His auld are looked better than mony ane's new;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now he lets 't wear ony way it will hing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And casts himself doure upon the corn bing.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O were we young now as we ance hae been,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We should hae been galloping down on yon green,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And linking it owre the lily-white lea&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And werena my heart light I wad die."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The light heart of Burns failed him at last,&mdash;failed him because,
enfeebled by disease and incapacitated from performing his excise<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2845" name="page2845">2845</a></span>
duties, his salary, which had never exceeded seventy pounds a year,
was reduced to half that beggarly sum; because he was so distressed
for money that he was obliged to solicit a loan of a one-pound note
from a friend: failed him, poor heart, because it was broken! He
took to his bed for the last time on July 21st, 1796, and two days
later, surrounded by his little family, he passed away in the thirty-eighth
year of his age.</p>

<p>Such was the life of Robert Burns,&mdash;the hard, struggling, erring,
suffering, manly life, of which his poetry is the imperishable record.
He was what his birth, his temperament, his circumstances, his
genius made him. He owed but little to books, and the books to
which he owed anything were written in his mother tongue. His
English reading, which was not extensive, harmed him rather than
helped him. No English author taught or could teach him anything.
He was not English, but Scottish,&mdash;Scottish in his nature and genius,
Scottish to his heart's core,&mdash;the singer of the Scottish people, their
greatest poet, and the greatest poet of his time.</p>

<h2><a name="JOHN_BURROUGHS" id="JOHN_BURROUGHS"></a>JOHN BURROUGHS</h2>

<p class="subtitle">(1837-)</p>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/cap_j.png" title="" alt="J" width="73" height="75" class="cap" />
<p class="cap_2"><span class="dcap">John Burroughs</span> was born in Roxbury, New York, April 3d,
1837, and like many other American youths who later in
life became distinguished, he went to school winters and
worked on the farm in summer. He grew up among people who
neither read books nor cared for them, and he considers this circumstance
best suited to his development. Early intercourse with
literary men would, he believes, have dwarfed his original faculty.</p></div>

<p class="caption smcap">John Burroughs</p>
</div>

<p>He began to write essays at the age of fourteen, but these early
literary efforts give little hint of his later
work, of that faculty for seeing, and commenting
on all that he saw in nature,
which became his chief characteristic. He
was especially fond of essays; one of his
first purchases with his own money was a
full set of Dr. Johnson, and for a whole
year he lived on 'The Idler' and 'The
Rambler' and tried to imitate their ponderous
prose. His first contributions to
literature, modeled on these essays, were
promptly returned. By chance he picked
up a volume of Emerson, the master who
was to revolutionize his whole manner of
thinking; and as he had fed on Dr. Johnson he fed on the 'Essays
and Miscellanies,' until a paper he wrote at nineteen on 'Expressions'
was accepted by the editor of the Atlantic, with a lurking
doubt whether it had not come to him on false pretenses, as it was
very much like an early essay of Emerson.</p>

<p>Mr. Burroughs ascribes to Emerson, who stimulated his religious
nature, his improved literary expression; while Whitman was to him
a great humanizing power, and Matthew Arnold taught him clear
thinking and clean writing. He had passed through these different
influences by the time he was twenty-one or twenty-two; had taught
for a while; and from 1863 to 1873 was vault-keeper and afterwards
chief of the organization division of the Bureau of National Banks,
in the Treasury Department. For several years afterward he was a
special national bank examiner.</p>

<p>The literary quality of his writings from the first captivates the
reader. He has the interpretive power which makes us see what he<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2868" name="page2868">2868</a></span>
sees and invites us to share his enjoyment in his strange adventures.
The stories of the wary trout and the pastoral bee, the ways of
sylvan folk, their quarrels and their love-making, are so many character
sketches on paper, showing a most intimate acquaintance with
nature.</p>

<p>He is a born naturalist. He tells us that from childhood he was
familiar with the homely facts of the barn, the cattle and the horses,
the sugar-making and the work of the corn-field, the hay-field, the
threshing, the planting, the burning of fallows. He "loved nature
in those material examples and subtle expressions, with a love passing
all the books in the world." But he also loved and knew books,
and this other love gives to his works their literary charm.</p>

<p>His account of a bird, a flower, or an open-air incident, however
painstaking and minute the record, teems with literary memories.
The sight of the Scotch hills recalls Shakespeare's line,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The tufty mountains where lie the nibbling sheep."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The plane-tree vocal with birds' voices recalls Tennyson,&mdash;"The pillared
dusk of sounding sycamores"; he hears the English chaffinch,
and remembers with keen delight that Drayton calls it "the throstle
with sharp thrills," and Ben Jonson "the lusty throstle." After much
wondering, he finds out why Shakespeare wrote</p>

<span class="i20">"The murmuring surge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That on the unnumbered idle pebbles chafes,"<br /></span>

<p>his own experience being that sea-shores are sandy; but the pebbled
cliffs of Folkestone, with not a grain of sand on the chalk foundation,
justified the poet.</p>

<p>This lover of nature loves not only the beautiful things he sees,
but he loves what they suggest, what they remind him of, what they
bid him aspire to. Like Wordsworth, he "looks on the hills with
tenderness, and makes deep friendship with the streams and groves."
He notes what he divines by observation. And what an observer he
is! He discovers that the bobolink goes south in the night. He
scraped an acquaintance with a yellow rumpled warbler who, taking
the reflection of the clouds and blue sky in a pond for a short cut
to the tropics, tried to cross it; with the result of his clinging for a
day and night to a twig that hung down in the water.</p>

<p>Burroughs has found that whatever bait you use in a trout
stream,&mdash;grasshopper, grub, or fly,&mdash;there is one thing you must
always put on your hook; namely, your heart. It is a morsel they
love above everything else. He tells us that man has sharper eyes
than a dog, a fox, or any of the wild creatures except the birds, but
not so sharp an ear or a nose; he says that a certain quality of
youth is indispensable in the angler, a certain unworldliness and<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2869" name="page2869">2869</a></span>
readiness to invest in an enterprise that does not pay in current
coin. He says that nature loves to enter a door another hand has
opened: a mountain view never looks better than when one has been
warmed up by the capture of a big trout. Like certain wary game,
she is best taken by seeming to pass her by, intent on other matters.
What he does not find out for himself, people tell him. From
a hedge-cutter he learns that some of the birds take an earth-bath
and some a water-bath, while a few take both; a farmer boy confided
to him that the reason we never see any small turtles is
because for two or three years the young turtles bury themselves in
the ground and keep hidden from observation. From a Maine farmer
he heard that both male and female hawks take part in incubation.
A barefooted New Jersey boy told him that "lampers" die as soon
as they have built their nests and laid their eggs. How apt he is in
similes! The pastoral fields of Scotland are "stall-fed," and the hill-sides
"wrinkled and dimpled, like the forms of fatted sheep."</p>

<p>And what other bird-lover has such charming fancies about birds,
in whom he finds a hundred human significances? "The song of the
bobolink," he says, "expresses hilarity; the sparrow sings faith, the
bluebird love, the catbirds pride, the white-eyed fly-catchers self-consciousness,
that of the hermit thrush spiritual serenity, while
there is something military in the call of the robin." Mr. Burroughs
has been compared with Thoreau, but he seems closer to White of
Selborne, whom he has commemorated in one of his most charming
essays. Like White, he is a literary man who is a born naturalist in
close intimacy with his brute neighbors and "rural nature's varied
shows." In both, the moral element is back of nature and the
source of her value and charm. Never nature for her own sake, but
for the sake of the soul that is above all and over all. Like White,
too, though by nature solitary, Burroughs is on cordial terms with
his kind. He is an accurate observer, and he takes Bryant to task
for giving an odor to the yellow violet, and Coleridge for making a
lark perch on the stalk of a foxglove. He gloats over a felicitous
expression, like Arnold's "blond meadow-sweet" and Tennyson's
"little speedwell's darling blue"; though in commenting on another
poet he waives the question of accuracy, and says "his happy literary
talent makes up for the poverty of his observation."</p>

<p>And again as with White, he walks through life slowly and in a
ruminating fashion, as though he had leisure to linger with the
impression of the moment. Incident he uses with reserve, but with
picturesque effects; figures do not dominate his landscape but humanize
it.</p>

<p>As a critic Mr. Burroughs most fully reveals his personality. In
his sketches of nature we see what he sees; in his critiques, what he<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2870" name="page2870">2870</a></span>
feels and thinks. The cry of discovery he made when 'Leaves of
Grass' fell into his hands found response in England and was
re-echoed in this country till Burroughs's strange delight in Whitman
seemed no longer strange, but an accepted fact in the history of
poetry. The essay on Emerson, his master, shows the same discriminating
mind. But as a revelation of both author and subject
there are few more delightful papers than Burroughs's essay on
Thoreau. In manner it is as pungent and as racy as Thoreau's
writings, and as epigrammatic as Emerson's; and his defense of
Thoreau against the English reviewer who dubbed him a "skulker"
has the sound of the trumpet and the martial tread of soldiers marching
to battle.</p>

<h3><a name="SHARP_EYES" id="SHARP_EYES"></a>SHARP EYES</h3>

<p class="subtitle">From 'Locusts and Wild Honey'</p>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="dcap">Noting</span> how one eye seconds and reinforces the other, I have
often amused myself by wondering what the effect would
be if one could go on opening eye after eye, to the number,
say, of a dozen or more. What would he see? Perhaps not
the invisible&mdash;not the odors of flowers or the fever germs in
the air&mdash;not the infinitely small of the microscope or the infinitely
distant of the telescope. This would require not so much
more eyes as an eye constructed with more and different lenses;
but would he not see with augmented power within the natural
limits of vision? At any rate, some persons seem to have
opened more eyes than others, they see with such force and distinctness;
their vision penetrates the tangle and obscurity where
that of others fails, like a spent or impotent bullet. How
many eyes did Gilbert White open? how many did Henry Thoreau?
how many did Audubon? how many does the hunter,
matching his sight against the keen and alert senses of a deer,
or a moose, or a fox, or a wolf? Not outward eyes, but inward.
We open another eye whenever we see beyond the first general
features or outlines of things&mdash;whenever we grasp the special
details and characteristic markings that this mask covers. Science
confers new powers of vision. Whenever you have learned to
discriminate the birds, or the plants, or the geological features
of a country, it is as if new and keener eyes were added.</p>

<p>Of course one must not only see sharply, but read aright
what he sees. The facts in the life of nature that are transpiring<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2871" name="page2871">2871</a></span>
about us are like written words that the observer is to arrange
into sentences. Or, the writing is a cipher and he must furnish
the key. A female oriole was one day observed very
much preoccupied under a shed where the refuse from the horse
stable was thrown. She hopped about among the barn fowls,
scolding them sharply when they came too near her. The stable,
dark and cavernous, was just beyond. The bird, not finding
what she wanted outside, boldly ventured into the stable, and
was presently captured by the farmer. What did she want? was
the query. What but a horse-hair for her nest, which was in an
apple-tree near by? and she was so bent on having one that I
have no doubt she would have tweaked one out of the horse's
tail had he been in the stable. Later in the season I examined
her nest, and found it sewed through and through with several
long horse-hairs, so that the bird persisted in her search till the
hair was found.</p>

<p>Little dramas and tragedies and comedies, little characteristic
scenes, are always being enacted in the lives of the birds, if our
eyes are sharp enough to see them. Some clever observer saw
this little comedy played among some English sparrows, and
wrote an account of it in his newspaper. It is too good not to
be true: A male bird brought to his box a large, fine goose-feather,
which is a great find for a sparrow and much coveted.
After he had deposited his prize and chattered his gratulations
over it, he went away in quest of his mate. His next-door
neighbor, a female bird, seeing her chance, quickly slipped in
and seized the feather,&mdash;and here the wit of the bird came out,
for instead of carrying it into her own box she flew with it to a
near tree and hid it in a fork of the branches, then went home,
and when her neighbor returned with his mate, was innocently
employed about her own affairs. The proud male, finding his
feather gone, came out of his box in a high state of excitement,
and with wrath in his manner and accusation on his tongue,
rushed into the cot of the female. Not finding his goods and
chattels there as he had expected, he stormed around awhile,
abusing everybody in general and his neighbor in particular, and
then went away as if to repair the loss. As soon as he was out
of sight, the shrewd thief went and brought the feather home
and lined her own domicile with it....</p>

<p>The bluebird is a home bird, and I am never tired of recurring
to him. His coming or reappearance in the spring marks a<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2872" name="page2872">2872</a></span>
new chapter in the progress of the season; things are never
quite the same after one has heard that note. The past spring
the males came about a week in advance of the females. A fine
male lingered about my grounds and orchard all that time,
apparently awaiting the arrival of his mate. He called and
warbled every day, as if he felt sure she was within earshot and
could be hurried up. Now he warbled half angrily or upbraidingly;
then coaxingly; then cheerily and confidently, the next
moment in a plaintive and far-away manner. He would half
open his wings, and twinkle them caressingly as if beckoning his
mate to his heart. One morning she had come, but was shy and
reserved. The fond male flew to a knot-hole in an old apple-tree
and coaxed her to his side. I heard a fine confidential warble&mdash;the
old, old story. But the female flew to a near tree and uttered
her plaintive, homesick note. The male went and got some
dry grass or bark in his beak and flew again to the hole in the
old tree, and promised unremitting devotion; but the other said
"Nay," and flew away in the distance. When he saw her going,
or rather heard her distant note, he dropped his stuff and cried
out in a tone that said plainly enough, "Wait a minute: one
word, please!" and flew swiftly in pursuit. He won her before
long, however, and early in April the pair were established in
one of the four or five boxes I had put up for them, but not
until they had changed their minds several times. As soon as
the first brood had flown, and while they were yet under their
parents' care, they began to nest in one of the other boxes, the
female as usual doing all the work and the male all the complimenting.
A source of occasional great distress to the mother-bird
was a white cat that sometimes followed me about. The cat had
never been known to catch a bird, but she had a way of watching
them that was very embarrassing to the bird. Whenever she
appeared, the mother bluebird set up that pitiful melodious plaint.
One morning the cat was standing by me, when the bird came
with her beak loaded with building material, and alighted above
me to survey the place before going into the box. When she
saw the cat she was greatly disturbed, and in her agitation could
not keep her hold upon all her material. Straw after straw came
eddying down, till not half her original burden remained. After
the cat had gone away the bird's alarm subsided; till presently,
seeing the coast clear, she flew quickly to the box and pitched in
her remaining straws with the greatest precipitation, and without<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2873" name="page2873">2873</a></span>
going in to arrange them as was her wont, flew away in evident
relief.</p>

<p>In the cavity of an apple-tree but a few yards off, and much
nearer the house than they usually build, a pair of high-holes, or
golden-shafted woodpeckers, took up their abode. A knot-hole
which led to the decayed interior was enlarged, the live wood
being cut away as clean as a squirrel would have done it. The
inside preparations I could not witness, but day after day as I
passed near I heard the bird hammering away, evidently beating
down obstructions and shaping and enlarging the cavity. The
chips were not brought out, but were used rather to floor the
interior. The woodpeckers are not nest-builders, but rather nest-carvers.</p>

<p>The time seemed very short before the voices of the young
were heard in the heart of the old tree,&mdash;at first feebly, but
waxing stronger day by day, until they could be heard many
rods distant. When I put my hand upon the trunk of the tree
they would set up an eager, expectant chattering; but if I
climbed up it toward the opening, they soon detected the unusual
sound and would hush quickly, only now and then uttering a
warning note. Long before they were fully fledged they clambered
up to the orifice to receive their food. As but one could
stand in the opening at a time, there was a good deal of elbowing
and struggling for this position. It was a very desirable one,
aside from the advantages it had when food was served; it looked
out upon the great shining world, into which the young birds
seemed never tired of gazing. The fresh air must have been a
consideration also, for the interior of a high-hole's dwelling is not
sweet. When the parent birds came with food, the young one in
the opening did not get it all; but after he had received a portion,
either on his own motion or on a hint from the old one,
he would give place to the one behind him. Still, one bird evidently
outstripped his fellows, and in the race of life was two or
three days in advance of them. His voice was the loudest and
his head oftenest at the window. But I noticed that when he
had kept the position too long, the others evidently made it
uncomfortable in his rear, and after "fidgeting" about awhile he
would be compelled to "back down." But retaliation was then
easy, and I fear his mates spent few easy moments at the outlook.
They would close their eyes and slide back into the cavity
as if the world had suddenly lost all its charms for them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page2874" name="page2874">2874</a></span>
This bird was of course the first to leave the nest. For two
days before that event he kept his position in the opening most
of the time, and sent forth his strong voice incessantly. The old
ones abstained from feeding him almost entirely, no doubt to
encourage his exit. As I stood looking at him one afternoon
and noticing his progress, he suddenly reached a resolution,&mdash;seconded,
I have no doubt, from the rear,&mdash;and launched forth
upon his untried wings. They served him well, and carried him
about fifty yards up-hill the first heat. The second day after, the
next in size and spirit left in the same manner; then another,
till only one remained. The parent birds ceased their visits to
him, and for one day he called and called till our ears were tired
of the sound. His was the faintest heart of all: then he had
none to encourage him from behind. He left the nest and clung
to the outer hole of the tree, and yelped and piped for an hour
longer; then he committed himself to his wings and went his
way like the rest.</p>

<p>A young farmer in the western part of New York sends me ...
some interesting observations about the cuckoo. He
says a large gooseberry-bush, standing in the border of an old
hedge-row in the midst of the open fields, and not far from his
house, was occupied by a pair of cuckoos for two seasons in succession;
and after an interval of a year, for two seasons more.
This gave him a good chance to observe them. He says the
mother-bird lays a single egg and sits upon it a number of days
before laying the second, so that he has seen one young bird
nearly grown, a second just hatched, and a whole egg all in the
nest at once. "So far as I have seen, this is the settled practice,&mdash;the
young leaving the nest one at a time, to the number
of six or eight. The young have quite the look of the young of
the dove in many respects. When nearly grown they are covered
with long blue pin-feathers as long as darning needles, without
a bit of plumage on them. They part on the back and
hang down on each side by their own weight. With its curious
feathers and misshapen body the young bird is anything but
handsome. They never open their mouths when approached,
as many young birds do, but sit perfectly still, hardly moving
when touched." He also notes the unnatural indifference of the
mother-bird when her nest and young are approached. She
makes no sound, but sits quietly on a near branch in apparent
perfect unconcern.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page2875" name="page2875">2875</a></span>
These observations, together with the fact that the egg of the
cuckoo is occasionally found in the nest of other birds, raise the
inquiry whether our bird is slowly relapsing into the habit of the
European species, which always foists its egg upon other birds;
or whether on the other hand it be not mending its manners in
this respect. It has but little to unlearn or forget in the one
case, but great progress to make in the other. How far is its
rudimentary nest&mdash;a mere platform of coarse twigs and dry stalks
of weeds&mdash;from the deep, compact, finely woven and finely modeled
nest of the goldfinch or <ins class="correction" title="Standardized from 'king-bird'">kingbird</ins>, and what a gulf between
its indifference toward its young and their solicitude! Its irregular
manner of laying also seems better suited to a parasite like our
cow-bird, or the European cuckoo, than to a regular nest-builder.</p>

<p>This observer, like most sharp-eyed persons, sees plenty of
interesting things as he goes about his work. He one day saw
a white swallow, which is of rare occurrence. He saw a bird, a
sparrow, he thinks, fly against the side of a horse and fill his
beak with hair from the loosened coat of the animal. He saw a
shrike pursue a chickadee, when the latter escaped by taking
refuge in a small hole in a tree. One day in early spring he
saw two hen-hawks that were circling and screaming high in air,
approach each other, extend a claw, and grasping them together,
fall toward the earth flapping and struggling as if they were tied
together; on nearing the ground they separated and soared aloft
again. He supposed that it was not a passage of war but of
love, and that the hawks were toying fondly with each other.</p>

<hr class="invis" />

<p>When the air is damp and heavy, swallows frequently hawk
for insects about cattle and moving herds in the field. My
farmer describes how they attended him one foggy day, as he
was mowing in the meadow with a mowing-machine. It had
been foggy for two days, and the swallows were very hungry
and the insects stupid and inert. When the sound of his
machine was heard, the swallows appeared and attended him like
a brood of hungry chickens. He says there was a continual
rush of purple wings over the "cutter-bar," and just where it was
causing the grass to tremble and fall. Without his assistance
the swallows would have gone hungry yet another day.</p>

<p>Of the hen-hawk he has observed that both the male and
female take part in incubation. "I was rather surprised," he
says, "on one occasion, to see how quickly they change places<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2876" name="page2876">2876</a></span>
on the nest. The nest was in a tall beech, and the leaves were
not yet fully out. I could see the head and neck of the hawk
over the edge of the nest, when I saw the other hawk coming
down through the air at full speed. I expected he would alight
near by, but instead of that he struck directly upon the nest,
his mate getting out of the way barely in time to avoid being
hit; it seemed almost as if he had knocked her off the nest. I
hardly see how they can make such a rush on the nest without
danger to the eggs."</p>

<p>The kingbird will worry the hawk as a whiffet dog will
worry a bear. It is by his persistence and audacity, not by any
injury he is capable of dealing his great antagonist. The kingbird
seldom more than dogs the hawk, keeping above and between
his wings and making a great ado; but my correspondent
says he once "saw a <ins class="correction" title="Standardized from 'king-bird'">kingbird</ins> riding on a hawk's back. The
hawk flew as fast as possible, and the kingbird sat upon his
shoulders in triumph until they had passed out of sight,"&mdash;tweaking
his feathers, no doubt, and threatening to scalp him the
next moment.</p>

<p>That near relative of the <ins class="correction" title="Standardized from 'king-bird'">kingbird</ins>, the great crested fly-catcher,
has one well-known peculiarity: he appears never to consider
his nest finished until it contains a cast-off snake-skin. My
alert correspondent one day saw him eagerly catch up an onion
skin and make off with it, either deceived by it or else thinking
it a good substitute for the coveted material.</p>

<p>One day in May, walking in the woods, I came upon a nest
of whippoorwill, or rather its eggs,&mdash;for it builds no nest,&mdash;two
elliptical whitish spotted eggs lying upon the dry leaves. My
foot was within a yard of the mother-bird before she flew. I
wondered what a sharp eye would detect curious or characteristic
in the ways of the bird, so I came to the place many
times and had a look. It was always a task to separate the
bird from her surroundings, though I stood within a few feet of
her, and knew exactly where to look. One had to bear on with
his eye, as it were, and refuse to be baffled. The sticks and
leaves, and bits of black or dark-brown bark, were all exactly
copied in the bird's plumage. And then she did sit so close and
simulate so well a shapeless decaying piece of wood or bark!
Twice I brought a companion, and guiding his eye to the spot,
noted how difficult it was for him to make out there, in full
view upon the dry leaves, any semblance to a bird. When the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2877" name="page2877">2877</a></span>
bird returned after being disturbed, she would alight within a
few inches of her eggs and then, after a moment's pause, hobble
awkwardly upon them.</p>

<p>After the young had appeared, all the wit of the bird came
into play. I was on hand the next day, I think. The mother-bird
sprang up when I was within a pace of her, and in doing
so fanned the leaves with her wings till they sprang up too; as
the leaves started the young started, and, being of the same
color, to tell which was the leaf and which the bird was a trying
task to any eye. I came the next day, when the same
tactics were repeated. Once a leaf fell upon one of the young
birds and nearly hid it. The young are covered with a reddish
down like a young partridge, and soon follow their mother about.
When disturbed they gave but one leap, then settled down, perfectly
motionless and stupid, with eyes closed. The parent bird,
on these occasions, made frantic efforts to decoy me away from
her young. She would fly a few paces and fall upon her breast,
and a spasm like that of death would run through her tremulous
outstretched wings and prostrate body. She kept a sharp eye out
the meanwhile to see if the ruse took, and if it did not she was
quickly cured, and moving about to some other point tried to
draw my attention as before. When followed she always alighted
upon the ground, dropping down in a sudden peculiar way. The
second or third day both old and young had disappeared.</p>

<p>The whippoorwill walks as awkwardly as a swallow, which
is as awkward as a man in a bag, and yet she manages to lead
her young about the woods. The latter, I think, move by leaps
and sudden spurts, their protective coloring shielding them most
effectively. Wilson once came upon the mother-bird and her
brood in the woods, and though they were at his very feet, was
so baffled by the concealment of the young that he was about to
give up the search, much disappointed, when he perceived something
"like a slight moldiness among the withered leaves, and,
on stooping down, discovered it to be a young whippoorwill,
seemingly asleep." Wilson's description of the young is very
accurate, as its downy covering does look precisely like a "slight
moldiness." Returning a few moments afterward to the spot to
get a pencil he had forgotten, he could find neither old nor
young.</p>

<p>It takes an eye to see a partridge in the woods, motionless
upon the leaves; this sense needs to be as sharp as that of smell<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2878" name="page2878">2878</a></span>
in hounds and pointers, and yet I know an unkempt youth that
seldom fails to see the bird and shoot it before it takes wing. I
think he sees it as soon as it sees him, and before it suspects
itself seen. What a training to the eye is hunting! To pick out
the game from its surroundings, the grouse from the leaves, the
gray squirrel from the mossy oak limb it hugs so closely, the red
fox from the ruddy or brown or gray field, the rabbit from the
stubble, or the white hare from the snow, requires the best
powers of this sense. A woodchuck motionless in the fields or
upon a rock looks very much like a large stone or bowlder, yet
a keen eye knows the difference at a glance, a quarter of a mile
away.</p>

<p>A man has a sharper eye than a dog, or a fox, or than any
of the wild creatures; but not so sharp an ear or nose. But in
the birds he finds his match. How quickly the old turkey discovers
the hawk, a mere speck against the sky, and how quickly
the hawk discovers you if you happen to be secreted in the
bushes, or behind the fence near which he alights! One advantage
the bird surely has; and that is, owing to the form, structure,
and position of the eye, it has a much larger field of vision&mdash;indeed,
can probably see in nearly every direction at the same
instant, behind as well as before. Man's field of vision embraces
less than half a circle horizontally, and still less vertically; his
brow and brain prevent him from seeing within many degrees of
the zenith without a movement of the head; the bird, on the
other hand, takes in nearly the whole sphere at a glance.</p>

<p>I find I see, almost without effort, nearly every bird within
sight in the field or wood I pass through (a flit of the wing, a
flirt of the tail, are enough, though the flickering leaves do all
conspire to hide them), and that with like ease the birds see
me, though unquestionably the chances are immensely in their
favor. The eye sees what it has the means of seeing, truly.
You must have the bird in your heart before you can find it in
the bush. The eye must have purpose and aim. No one ever
yet found the walking-fern who did not have the walking-fern
in his mind. A person whose eye is full of Indian relics picks
them up in every field he walks through.</p>

<p>One season I was interested in the tree-frogs, especially the
tiny pipers that one hears about the woods and brushy fields&mdash;the
hylas of the swamps become a denizen of trees; I had never
seen him in this new rÃ´le. But this season having them in mind,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2879" name="page2879">2879</a></span>
or rather being ripe for them, I several times came across them.
One Sunday, walking amid some bushes, I captured two. They
leaped before me as doubtless they had done many times before,
but though not looking for or thinking of them, yet they were
quickly recognized, because the eye had been commissioned to
find them. On another occasion, not long afterward, I was
hurriedly loading my gun in the October woods in hopes of
overtaking a gray squirrel that was fast escaping through the
treetops, when one of these Lilliput frogs, the color of the fast-yellowing
leaves, leaped near me. I saw him only out of the
corner of my eye, and yet bagged him, because I had already
made him my own.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the habit of observation is the habit of clear and
decisive gazing; not by a first casual glance, but by a steady,
deliberate aim of the eye are the rare and characteristic things
discovered. You must look intently and hold your eye firmly
to the spot, to see more than do the rank and file of mankind.
The sharpshooter picks out his man and knows him with fatal
certainty from a stump, or a rock, or a cap on a pole. The
phrenologists do well to locate not only form, color, weight, etc.,
in the region of the eye, but a faculty which they call individuality&mdash;that
which separates, discriminates, and sees in every
object its essential character. This is just as necessary to the
naturalist as to the artist or the poet. The sharp eye notes specific
points and differences,&mdash;it seizes upon and preserves the
individuality of the thing.</p>

<hr class="invis" />

<p>We think we have looked at a thing sharply until we are asked
for its specific features. I thought I knew exactly the form of
the leaf of the tulip-tree, until one day a lady asked me to draw
the outlines of one. A good observer is quick to take a hint and
to follow it up. Most of the facts of nature, especially in the
life of the birds and animals, are well screened. We do not see
the play, because we do not look intently enough.</p>

<hr class="invis" />

<p>Birds, I say, have wonderfully keen eyes. Throw a fresh bone
or a piece of meat upon the snow in winter, and see how soon
the crows will discover it and be on hand. If it be near the
house or barn, the crow that first discovers it will alight near it,
to make sure that he is not deceived; then he will go away and
soon return with a companion. The two alight a few yards from<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2880" name="page2880">2880</a></span>
the bone, and after some delay, during which the vicinity is
sharply scrutinized, one of the crows advances boldly to within a
few feet of the coveted prize. Here he pauses, and if no trick
is discovered, and the meat be indeed meat, he seizes it and
makes off.</p>

<p>One midwinter I cleared away the snow under an apple-tree
near the house, and scattered some corn there. I had not seen
a bluejay for weeks, yet that very day they found my corn, and
after that they came daily and partook of it, holding the kernels
under their feet upon the limbs of the trees and pecking them
vigorously.</p>

<p>Of course the woodpecker and his kind have sharp eyes. Still
I was surprised to see how quickly Downy found out some bones
that were placed in a convenient place under the shed to be
pounded up for the hens. In going out to the barn I often disturbed
him making a meal off the bits of meat that still adhered
to them.</p>

<p>"Look intently enough at anything," said a poet to me one
day, "and you will see something that would otherwise escape
you." I thought of the remark as I sat on a stump in the opening
of the woods one spring day. I saw a small hawk approaching;
he flew to a tall tulip-tree and alighted on a large limb near
the top. He eyed me and I eyed him. Then the bird disclosed
a trait that was new to me; he hopped along the limb to a small
cavity near the trunk, when he thrust in his head and pulled out
some small object and fell to eating it. After he had partaken
of it some minutes he put the remainder back in his larder and
flew away. I had seen something like feathers eddying slowly
down as the hawk ate, and on approaching the spot found the
feathers of a sparrow here and there clinging to the bushes beneath
the tree. The hawk then&mdash;commonly called the chicken
hawk&mdash;is as provident as a mouse or squirrel, and lays by a store
against a time of need; but I should not have discovered the fact
had I not held my eye to him.</p>

<p>An observer of the birds is attracted by any unusual sound or
commotion among them. In May and June, when other birds
are most vocal, the jay is a silent bird; he goes sneaking about
the orchards and the groves as silent as a pickpocket; he is robbing
birds'-nests and he is very anxious that nothing should be
said about it, but in the fall none so quick and loud to cry
"Thief, thief" as he. One December morning a troop of them<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2881" name="page2881">2881</a></span>
discovered a little screech-owl secreted in the hollow trunk of an
old apple-tree near my house. How they found the owl out is a
mystery, since it never ventures forth in the light of day; but
they did, and proclaimed the fact with great emphasis. I suspect
the bluebirds first told them, for these birds are constantly peeping
into holes and crannies, both spring and fall. Some unsuspecting
bird probably entered the cavity, prospecting for a place
for next year's nest, or else looking out a likely place to pass
a cold night, when it has rushed with very important news. A
boy who should unwittingly venture into a bear's den when
Bruin was at home could not be more astonished and alarmed
than a bluebird would be on finding itself in the cavity of a decayed
tree with an owl. At any rate, the bluebirds joined the
jays, in calling the attention of all whom it might concern to the
fact that a culprit of some sort was hiding from the light of day
in the old apple-tree. I heard the notes of warning and alarm
and approached to within eyeshot. The bluebirds were cautious,
and hovered about uttering their peculiar twittering calls; but
the jays were bolder, and took turns looking in at the cavity and
deriding the poor shrinking owl. A jay would alight in the
entrance of the hole, and flirt and peer and attitudinize, and then
fly away crying "Thief, thief, thief," at the top of his voice.</p>

<p>I climbed up and peered into the opening, and could just
descry the owl clinging to the inside of the tree. I reached in
and took him out, giving little heed to the threatening snapping
of his beak. He was as red as a fox and as yellow-eyed as a
cat. He made no effort to escape, but planted his claws in my
forefinger and clung there with a grip that soon grew uncomfortable.
I placed him in the loft of an out-house in hopes of
getting better acquainted with him. By day he was a very willing
prisoner, scarcely moving at all even when approached and
touched with the hand, but looking out upon the world with half-closed
sleepy eyes. But at night what a change; how alert, how
wild, how active! He was like another bird; he darted about
with wild fearful eyes, and regarded me like a cornered cat. I
opened the window, and swiftly, but as silently as a shadow, he
glided out into the congenial darkness, and perhaps ere this has
revenged himself upon the sleeping jay or bluebird that first
betrayed his hiding-place.</p>

<p class="cap_3"><span class="dcap">It has</span> sometimes been said that the roving propensities of
Sir Richard Burton are attributable to a slight infusion of
gipsy blood; but if this pedigree were to be assumed for all
instinctively nomadic Englishmen, it would make family trees as farcical
in general as they often are now. At any rate, Burton early
showed a love for travel which circumstances strengthened. Although
born in Hertfordshire, England, he spent much of his boyhood on
the Continent, where he was educated under tutors. He returned
for a course at Oxford, after which, at
twenty-one, he entered the Indian service.
For nineteen years he was in the Bombay
army corps, the first ten in active service,
principally in the Sindh Survey, on Sir
Charles Napier's staff. He also served in
the Crimea as Chief of Staff to General
Blatsom, and was chief organizer of the
irregular cavalry. For nearly twenty-six
years he was in the English consular service
in Africa, Asia, South America, and
Europe.</p></div>

<p class="caption smcap">Richard Burton</p>
</div>

<p>In 1852, when upon leave, Captain
Burton accomplished one of his most striking
feats. Disguised as an Afghan Moslem,
he went on a pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina, in the hope of
finding out "something of the great eastern wilderness marked 'Ruba
el Khala' (the Empty Abode) on our maps." For months he successfully
braved the imminent danger of detection and death. Conspicuous
among his explorations is his trip of 1856, when with Speke he
discovered the lake regions of Central Africa. The bitter Speke controversy
which followed, dividing geographers for a time into two
contending factions, deprived Burton of the glory which he merited
and drew upon him much unfriendly criticism.</p>

<p>He had the true ardor of the discoverer. In 'First Footsteps in
Eastern Africa' he shows his unhesitating bravery again, when penetrating
the mysterious, almost mythical walled city of Harar. After
many dangers and exhausting experiences he sees the goal at last.
"The spectacle, materially speaking, was a disappointment," he says.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2884" name="page2884">2884</a></span>
"Nothing conspicuous appeared but two gray minarets of rude shape.
Many would grudge exposing their lives to win so paltry a prize.
But of all that have attempted, none ever succeeded in entering that
pile of stones."</p>

<p>Richard Burton carefully worded his varied experiences, and has
left about fifty valuable and interesting volumes. Among the best
known are 'Sindh,' 'The Lake Regions of Central Africa,' 'Two
Trips to Gorilla Land,' and 'Ultima Thule.' With his knowledge of
thirty-five languages and dialects he gained an intimate acquaintance
with the people among whom he lived, and was enabled to furnish
the world much novel information in his strong, straightforward style.</p>

<p>Perhaps his most noteworthy literary achievement was his fine
translation of the 'Arabian Nights,' which appeared in 1885. Of this
his wife wrote:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"This grand Arabian work I consider my husband's Magnum Opus....
We were our own printers and our own publishers, and we made, between
September 1885 and November 1888, sixteen thousand guineas&mdash;six thousand
of which went for publishing and ten thousand into our own pockets,
and it came just in time to give my husband the comforts and luxuries and
freedom that gilded the five last years of his life. When he died there were
four florins left, which I put into the poor-box."</p></blockquote>

<p>This capable soldier and author was very inadequately recompensed.
As a soldier, his bravery and long service brought him only
the rank of Captain. In the civil service he was given only second-class
consulates. The French Geographical Society, and also the
Royal Geographical Society of England, each awarded him a gold
medal, but the latter employed him upon only one expedition. At
the age of sixty-five he was knighted. He had no other honors.
This lack of recognition was undoubtedly a mortification, although
toward the end of his career he writes philosophically:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"The press are calling me 'the neglected Englishman,' and I want to
express to them the feelings of pride and gratitude with which I have seen
the exertions of my brethren of the press to procure for me a tardy justice.
The public is a fountain of honor which amply suffices all my aspirations;
it is the more honorable as it will not allow a long career to be ignored
because of catechisms or creed."</p></blockquote>

<p>He comforted himself, no doubt, with the belief that his outspoken
skepticism was the cause of this lack of advancement, and
that he was in some sort a martyr to freedom of thought; but one
may be excused for discrediting this in the face of so many contrary
instances. Capable men are too scarce to throw aside for such
things in this century. The real and sufficient reason was his
equally outspoken criticism of his superior officers in every department.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2885" name="page2885">2885</a></span>
A subordinate may and often does know more than his
masters; but if he wishes the luxury of advertising the fact, he must
pay for it with their ill-will and his own practical suppression.</p>

<p>Lady Burton was also an author; her 'Inner Life in Syria' and
'Arabia, Egypt, and India' are bright and entertaining. But her
most important work is the 'Life of Sir Richard F. Burton,'
published in 1892, two years after her husband's death. This unorganized
mass of interesting material, in spite of carelessness and
many faults of style and taste, shows her a ready observer, with
a clever and graphic way of stating her impressions.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_PRETERNATURAL_IN_FICTION" id="THE_PRETERNATURAL_IN_FICTION"></a>THE PRETERNATURAL IN FICTION</h3>

<p class="subtitle">From the Essay on 'The Book of a Thousand Nights and a <ins class="correction" title="Added missing quote">Night'</ins></p>

<p class="dropcapq"><small>"</small><span class="drop">A</span><span class="dcap">s the</span> active world is inferior to the rational soul," says
Bacon, with his normal sound sense, "so Fiction gives
to Mankind what History denies, and in some measure
satisfies the Mind with Shadows when it cannot enjoy the Substance.
And as real History gives us not the success of things
according to the deserts of vice and virtue, Fiction corrects it
and presents us with the fates and fortunes of persons rewarded
and punished according to merit." But I would say still more.
History paints or attempts to paint life as it is, a mighty maze
with or without a plan; Fiction shows or would show us life as
it should be, wisely ordered and laid down on fixed lines. Thus
Fiction is not the mere handmaid of History: she has a household
of her own, and she claims to be the triumph of Art,
which, as Goethe remarked, is "Art because it is not Nature."
Fancy, <i>la folle du logis</i>, is "that kind and gentle portress who
holds the gate of Hope wide open, in opposition to Reason,
the surly and scrupulous guard." As Palmerin of England says,
and says well:&mdash;"For that the report of noble deeds doth urge
the courageous mind to equal those who bear most commendation
of their approved valiancy; this is the fair fruit of Imagination
and of ancient histories." And last, but not least, the
faculty of Fancy takes count of the cravings of man's nature for
the marvelous, the impossible, and of his higher aspirations
for the Ideal, the Perfect; she realizes the wild dreams and
visions of his generous youth, and portrays for him a portion of
that "other and better world," with whose expectation he would
console his age.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page2886" name="page2886">2886</a></span>
The imaginative varnish of 'The Nights' serves admirably as
a foil to the absolute realism of the picture in general. We
enjoy being carried away from trivial and commonplace characters,
scenes, and incidents; from the matter-of-fact surroundings
of a workaday world, a life of eating and drinking, sleeping
and waking, fighting and loving, into a society and a <i>mise-en-scÃ¨ne</i>
which we suspect can exist and which we know do not.
Every man, at some turn or term of his life, has longed for
supernatural powers and a glimpse of Wonderland. Here he is
in the midst of it. Here he sees mighty spirits summoned to
work the human mite's will, however whimsical; who can transport
him in an eye-twinkling whithersoever he wishes; who can
ruin cities and build palaces of gold and silver, gems and
jacinths; who can serve up delicate viands and delicious drinks
in priceless chargers and impossible cups, and bring the choicest
fruits from farthest Orient: here he finds magas and magicians
who can make kings of his friends, slay armies of his foes, and
bring any number of beloveds to his arms.</p>

<p>And from this outraging probability and outstripping possibility
arises not a little of that strange fascination exercised for
nearly two centuries upon the life and literature of Europe by
'The Nights,' even in their mutilated and garbled form. The
reader surrenders himself to the spell, feeling almost inclined to
inquire, "And why may it not be true?" His brain is dazed
and dazzled by the splendors which flash before it, by the sudden
procession of Jinns and Jinniyahs, demons and fairies, some
hideous, others preternaturally beautiful; by good wizards and
evil sorcerers, whose powers are unlimited for weal and for woe;
by mermen and mermaids, flying horses, talking animals, and
reasoning elephants; by magic rings and their slaves, and by
talismanic couches which rival the carpet of Solomon. Hence, as
one remarks, these Fairy Tales have pleased and still continue to
please almost all ages, all ranks, and all different capacities.</p>

<p>Dr. Hawkesworth observes that these Fairy Tales find favor
"because even their machinery, wild and wonderful as it is, has
its laws; and the magicians and enchanters perform nothing but
what was naturally to be expected from such beings, after we
had once granted them existence." Mr. Heron "rather supposes
the very contrary is the truth of the fact. It is surely the
strangeness, the unknown nature, the anomalous character of the
supernatural agents here employed, that makes them to operate<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2887" name="page2887">2887</a></span>
so powerfully on our hopes, fears, curiosities, sympathies, and in
short, on all the feelings of our hearts. We see men and women
who possess qualities to recommend them to our favor, subjected
to the influence of beings whose good or ill will, power or weakness,
attention or neglect, are regulated by motives and circumstances
which we cannot comprehend: and hence we naturally
tremble for their fate with the same anxious concern as we
should for a friend wandering in a dark night amidst torrents
and precipices; or preparing to land on a strange island, while
he knew not whether he should be received on the shore by
cannibals waiting to tear him piecemeal and devour him, or by
gentle beings disposed to cherish him with fond hospitality."</p>

<p>Both writers have expressed themselves well; but meseems
each has secured, as often happens, a fragment of the truth and
holds it to be the whole Truth. Granted that such spiritual
creatures as Jinns walk the earth, we are pleased to find them so
very human, as wise and as foolish in word and deed as ourselves;
similarly we admire in a landscape natural forms like
those of Staffa or the Palisades, which favor the works of architecture.
Again, supposing such preternaturalisms to be around
and amongst us, the wilder and more capricious they prove, the
more our attention is excited and our forecasts are baffled, to be
set right in the end. But this is not all. The grand source of
pleasure in fairy tales is the natural desire to learn more of
the Wonderland which is known to many as a word and nothing
more, like Central Africa before the last half-century; thus the
interest is that of the "personal narrative" of a grand exploration,
to one who delights in travels. The pleasure must be
greatest where faith is strongest; for instance, amongst imaginative
races like the Kelts, and especially Orientals, who imbibe
supernaturalism with their mothers' milk. "I am persuaded,"
writes Mr. Bayle St. John, "that the great scheme of preternatural
energy, so fully developed in 'The Thousand and One
Nights,' is believed in by the majority of the inhabitants of all
the religious professions both in Syria and Egypt." He might
have added, "by every reasoning being from prince to peasant,
from Mullah to Badawi, between Marocco and Outer Ind."...</p>

<p>Dr. Johnson thus sums up his notice of 'The Tempest':&mdash;"Whatever
might have been the intention of their author, these
tales are made instrumental to the production of many characters,
diversified with boundless invention, and preserved with<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2888" name="page2888">2888</a></span>
profound skill in nature, extensive knowledge of opinions, and
accurate observation of life. Here are exhibited princes, courtiers,
and sailors, all speaking in their real characters. There is
the agency of airy spirits and of earthy goblins, the operations of
magic, the tumults of a storm, the adventures on a desert island,
the native effusion of untaught affection, the punishment of guilt,
and the final happiness of those for whom our passions and
reason are equally interested."</p>

<p>We can fairly say this much and far more for our Tales.
Viewed as a <i>tout ensemble</i> in full and complete form, they are
a drama of Eastern life, and a Dance of Death made sublime by
faith and the highest emotions, by the certainty of expiation and
the fullness of atoning equity, where virtue is victorious, vice is
vanquished, and the ways of Allah are justified to man. They are
a panorama which remains ken-speckle upon the mental retina.
They form a phantasmagoria in which archangels and angels,
devils and goblins, men of air, of fire, of water, naturally mingle
with men of earth; where flying horses and talking fishes are
utterly <ins class="correction" title="Original was 'realistic:'">realistic;</ins> where King and Prince meet fisherman and
pauper, lamia and cannibal; where citizen jostles Badawi, eunuch
meets knight; the Kazi hob-nobs with the thief; the pure and
pious sit down to the same tray with the pander and the procuress;
where the professional religionist, the learned Koranist,
and the strictest moralist consort with the wicked magician, the
scoffer, and the debauchee-poet like Abu Nowas; where the
courtier jests with the boor, and where the sweep is bedded with
the noble lady. And the characters are "finished and quickened
by a few touches swift and sure as the glance of sunbeams."
The whole is a kaleidoscope where everything falls into picture;
gorgeous palaces and pavilions; grisly underground caves and
deadly wolds; gardens fairer than those of the Hesperid; seas
dashing with clashing billows upon enchanted mountains; valleys
of the Shadow of Death; air-voyages and promenades in the
abysses of ocean; the duello, the battle, and the siege; the wooing
of maidens and the marriage-rite. All the splendor and
squalor, the beauty and baseness, the glamor and grotesqueness,
the magic and the mournfulness, the bravery and baseness of
Oriental life are here: its pictures of the three great Arab passions&mdash;love,
war, and fancy&mdash;entitle it to be called 'Blood,
Musk, and Hashish.' And still more, the genius of the story-teller
quickens the dry bones of history, and by adding Fiction<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2889" name="page2889">2889</a></span>
to Fact revives the dead past; the Caliphs and the Caliphate
return to Baghdad and Cairo, whilst Asmodeus kindly removes
the terrace-roof of every tenement and allows our curious glances
to take in the whole interior. This is perhaps the best proof of
their power. Finally the picture-gallery opens with a series of
weird and striking adventures, and shows as a tail-piece an idyllic
scene of love and wedlock, in halls before reeking with lust and
blood.</p>

<h3><a name="A_JOURNEY_IN_DISGUISE" id="A_JOURNEY_IN_DISGUISE"></a>A JOURNEY IN DISGUISE</h3>

<p class="subtitle">From 'The Personal Narrative of a Pilgrimage to El Medinah and Meccah'</p>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="dcap">The</span> thoroughbred wanderer's idiosyncrasy I presume to be a
composition of what phrenologists call "inhabitiveness" and
"locality," equally and largely developed. After a long and
toilsome march, weary of the way, he drops into the nearest
place of rest to become the most domestic of men. For a while
he smokes the "pipe of permanence" with an infinite zest; he
delights in various siestas during the day, relishing withal a long
sleep at night; he enjoys dining at a fixed dinner hour, and
wonders at the demoralization of the mind which cannot find
means of excitement in chit-chat or small talk, in a novel or a
newspaper. But soon the passive fit has passed away; again a
paroxysm of <i>ennui</i> coming on by slow degrees, Viator loses appetite,
he walks about his room all night, he yawns at conversations,
and a book acts upon him as a narcotic. The man wants
to wander, and he must do so or he shall die.</p>

<p>After about a month most pleasantly spent at Alexandria, I
perceived the approach of the enemy, and as nothing hampered
my incomings and outgoings, I surrendered. The world was
"all before me," and there was pleasant excitement in plunging
single-handed into its chilling depths. My Alexandrian Shaykh,
whose heart fell victim to a new "jubbeh" which I had given in
exchange for his tattered zaabut, offered me in consideration of
a certain monthly stipend the affections of a brother and religious
refreshment, proposing to send his wife back to her papa,
and to accompany me in the capacity of private chaplain to
the other side of Kaf. I politely accepted the "brÃ¼derschaft,"
but many reasons induced me to decline his society and services.
In the first place, he spoke the detestable Egyptian jargon.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2890" name="page2890">2890</a></span>
Secondly, it was but prudent to lose the "spoor" between Alexandria
and Suez. And thirdly, my "brother" had shifting eyes
(symptoms of fickleness), close together (indices of cunning); a
flat-crowned head and large ill-fitting lips, signs which led me
to think lightly of his honesty, firmness, and courage. Phrenology
and physiognomy, be it observed, disappoint you often
among civilized people, the proper action of whose brains and
features is impeded by the external pressure of education, accident,
example, habit, necessity, and what not. But they are
tolerably safe guides when groping your way through the mind
of man in his natural state, a being of impulse in that chrysalis
stage of mental development which is rather instinct than reason.
But before my departure there was much to be done.</p>

<p>The land of the Pharaohs is becoming civilized, and unpleasantly
so: nothing can be more uncomfortable than its present
middle state between barbarism and the reverse. The prohibition
against carrying arms is rigid as in Italy; all "violence" is violently
denounced; and beheading being deemed cruel, the most
atrocious crimes, as well as those small political offenses which
in the days of the Mamelukes would have led to a beyship or
a bowstring, receive fourfold punishment by deportation to Faizoghli,
the local Cayenne. If you order your peasant to be
flogged, his friends gather in threatening hundreds at your gates;
when you curse your boatman, he complains to your consul; the
dragomans afflict you with strange wild notions about honesty; a
government order prevents you from using vituperative language
to the "natives" in general; and the very donkey-boys are becoming
cognizant of the right of man to remain unbastinadoed.
Still the old leaven remains behind; here, as elsewhere in
"morning-land," you cannot hold your own without employing
your fists. The passport system, now dying out of Europe, has
sprung up, or rather revived, in Egypt with peculiar vigor. Its
good effects claim for it our respect; still we cannot but lament
its inconvenience. <i>We</i>, I mean real Easterns. As strangers&mdash;even
those whose beards have whitened in the land&mdash;know absolutely
nothing of what unfortunate natives must endure, I am
tempted to subjoin a short sketch of my adventures in search of
a Tezkireh at Alexandria.</p>

<p>Through ignorance which might have cost me dear but for
my friend Larking's weight with the local authorities, I had
neglected to provide myself with a passport in England; and it<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2891" name="page2891">2891</a></span>
was not without difficulty, involving much unclean dressing and
an unlimited expenditure of broken English, that I obtained from
the consul at Alexandria a certificate declaring me to be an
Indo-British subject named Abdullah, by profession a doctor,
aged thirty, and not distinguished&mdash;at least so the frequent
blanks seemed to denote&mdash;by any remarkable conformation of
eyes, nose, or cheek. For this I disbursed a dollar. And here
let me record the indignation with which I did it. That mighty
Britain&mdash;the mistress of the seas&mdash;the ruler of one-sixth of mankind&mdash;should
charge five shillings to pay for the shadow of her
protecting wing! That I cannot speak my modernized "civis
sum Romanus" without putting my hand into my pocket, in order
that these officers of the Great Queen may not take too ruinously
from a revenue of fifty-six millions! Oh the meanness of our
magnificence! the littleness of our greatness!</p>

<p>My new passport would not carry me without the Zabit or
Police Magistrate's counter-signature, said the consul. Next day
I went to the Zabit, who referred me to the Muhafiz (Governor)
of Alexandria, at whose gate I had the honor of squatting at
least three hours, till a more compassionate clerk vouchsafed the
information that the proper place to apply to was the Diwan
Kharijiyeh (the Foreign Office). Thus a second day was utterly
lost. On the morning of the third I started as directed for the
place, which crowns the Headland of Figs. It is a huge and
couthless shell of building in parallelogrammic form, containing
all kinds of public offices in glorious confusion, looking with their
glaring whitewashed faces upon a central court, where a few
leafless wind-wrung trees seem struggling for the breath of life
in an eternal atmosphere of clay, dust, and sun-blaze.</p>

<p>The first person I addressed was a Kawwas or police officer,
who, coiled comfortably up in a bit of shade fitting his person
like a robe, was in full enjoyment of the Asiatic "Kaif." Having
presented the consular certificate and briefly stated the
nature of my business, I ventured to inquire what was the right
course to pursue for a visÃ¡.</p>

<p>They have little respect for Dervishes, it appears, at Alexandria!
"M'adri" (Don't know), growled the man of authority,
without moving anything but the quantity of tongue necessary
for articulation.</p>

<p>Now there are three ways of treating Asiatic officials,&mdash;by
bribe, by bullying, or by bothering them with a dogged perse<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2892" name="page2892">2892</a></span>verance
into attending to you and your concerns. The latter is
the peculiar province of the poor; moreover, this time I resolved
for other reasons to be patient. I repeated my question in
almost the same words. "Ruh!" (Be off) was what I obtained
for all reply. By this time the questioned went so far as to
open his eyes. Still I stood twirling the paper in my hands, and
looking very humble and very persevering, till a loud "Ruh ya
Kalb!" (Go, O dog!) converted into a responsive curse the little
speech I was preparing about the brotherhood of El-Islam and
the mutual duties obligatory on true believers. I then turned
away slowly and fiercely, for the next thing might have been a
cut with the Kurbaj [bastinado], and by the hammer of Thor!
British flesh and blood could never have stood that.</p>

<p>After which satisfactory scene,&mdash;for satisfactory it was in one
sense, proving the complete fitness of the Dervish's dress,&mdash;I
tried a dozen other promiscuous sources of information,&mdash;policemen,
grooms, scribes, donkey-boys, and idlers in general. At
length, wearied of patience, I offered a soldier some pinches of
tobacco and promised him an Oriental sixpence if he would
manage the business for me. The man was interested by the
tobacco and the pence; he took my hand, and inquiring the
while he went along, led me from place to place till, mounting a
grand staircase, I stood in the presence of Abbas Effendi, the
governor's Naib or deputy.</p>

<p>It was a little whey-faced black-bearded Turk, coiled up in the
usual conglomerate posture upon a calico-covered divan, at the
end of a long bare large-windowed room. Without deigning
even to nod the head which hung over his shoulder with transcendent
listlessness and affectation of pride, in answer to my
salams and benedictions, he eyed me with wicked eyes and
faintly ejaculated "Minent?" Then hearing that I was a Dervish
and doctor,&mdash;he must be an Osmanli Voltairian, that little
Turk,&mdash;the official snorted a contemptuous snort. He condescendingly
added, however, that the proper source to seek was
"Taht," which, meaning simply "below," conveyed rather imperfect
information in a topographical point of view to a stranger.
At length however my soldier guide found out that a room in
the custom-house bore the honorable appellation of "Foreign
Office." Accordingly I went there, and after sitting at least a
couple of hours at the bolted door in the noonday sun, was told,
with a fury which made me think I had sinned, that the officer<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2893" name="page2893">2893</a></span>
in whose charge the department was had been presented with an
olive-branch in the morning, and consequently that business was
not to be done that day. The angry-faced official communicated
the intelligence to a large group of Anadolian, Caramanian, Bosniac,
and Roumelian Turks,&mdash;sturdy, undersized, broad-shouldered,
bare-legged, splay-footed, horny-fisted, dark-browed, honest-looking
mountaineers, who were lounging about with long pistols and
yataghans stuck in their broad sashes, head-gear composed of
immense tarbooshes with proportionate turbans coiled round
them, and two or three suits of substantial clothes&mdash;even at this
season of the year&mdash;upon their shoulders.</p>

<p>Like myself they had waited some hours, but they were not
patient under disappointment: they bluntly told the angry official
that he and his master were a pair of idlers, and the curses that
rumbled and gurgled in their hairy throats as they strode towards
the door sounded like the growling of wild beasts.</p>

<p>Thus was another day truly Orientally lost. On the morrow
however I obtained permission, in the character of Dr. Abdullah,
to visit any part of Egypt I pleased, and to retain possession of
my dagger and pistols.</p>

<p>And now I must explain what induced me to take so much
trouble about a passport. The home reader naturally inquires,
Why not travel under your English name?</p>

<p>For this reason. In the generality of barbarous countries you
must either proceed, like Bruce, preserving the "dignity of manhood"
and carrying matters with a high hand, or you must worm
your way by timidity and subservience; in fact, by becoming an
animal too contemptible for man to let or injure. But to pass
through the Holy Land you must either be a born believer, or
have become one; in the former case you may demean yourself
as you please, in the latter a path is ready prepared for you.
My spirit could not bend to own myself a Burma, a renegade&mdash;to
be pointed at and shunned and catechized, an object of
suspicion to the many and of contempt to all. Moreover, it
would have obstructed the aim of my wanderings. The convert
is always watched with Argus eyes, and men do not willingly
give information to a "new Moslem," especially a Frank: they
suspect his conversion to be a feigned or a forced one, look
upon him as a spy, and let him see as little of life as possible.
Firmly as was my heart set upon traveling in Arabia, by Heaven!
I would have given up the dear project rather than purchase a<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2894" name="page2894">2894</a></span>
doubtful and partial success at such a price. Consequently I
had no choice but to appear as a born believer, and part of my
birthright in that respectable character was toil and trouble in
obtaining a tezkirah.</p>

<p>Then I had to provide myself with certain necessaries for
the way. These were not numerous. The silver-mounted dressing-case
is here supplied by a rag containing a miswak, a bit of
soap, and a comb&mdash;wooden, for bone and tortoise-shell are not,
religiously speaking, correct. Equally simple was my wardrobe:
a change or two of clothing. The only article of canteen description
was a zemzemiyah, a goatskin water-bag, which communicates
to its contents, especially when new, a ferruginous aspect
and a wholesome though hardly an attractive flavor of tanno-gelatine.
This was a necessary; to drink out of a tumbler,
possibly fresh from pig-eating lips, would have entailed a certain
loss of reputation. For bedding and furniture I had a coarse
Persian rug&mdash;which, besides being couch, acts as chair, table,
and oratory,&mdash;a cotton-stuffed chintz-covered pillow, a blanket in
case of cold, and a sheet, which does duty for tent and mosquito
curtains in nights of heat. As shade is a convenience not always
procurable, another necessary was a huge cotton umbrella of
Eastern make, brightly yellow, suggesting the idea of an overgrown
marigold. I had also a substantial housewife, the gift of
a kind friend: it was a roll of canvas, carefully soiled, and garnished
with needles and thread, cobblers' wax, buttons, and other
such articles. These things were most useful in lands where
tailors abound not; besides which, the sight of a man darning
his coat or patching his slippers teems with pleasing ideas of humility.
A dagger, a brass inkstand and penholder stuck in the
belt, and a mighty rosary, which on occasion might have been
converted into a weapon of offense, completed my equipment.
I must not omit to mention the proper method of carrying
money, which in these lands should never be intrusted to box or
bag. A common cotton purse secured in a breast pocket (for
Egypt now abounds in that civilized animal the pickpocket) contained
silver pieces and small change. My gold, of which I
carried twenty-five sovereigns, and papers, were committed to a
substantial leathern belt of Maghrabi manufacture, made to be
strapped round the waist under the dress. This is the Asiatic
method of concealing valuables, and a more civilized one than
ours in the last century, when Roderick Random and his com<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2895" name="page2895">2895</a></span>panion
"sewed their money between the lining and the waistband
of their breeches, except some loose silver for immediate expense
on the road." The great inconvenience of the belt is its weight,
especially where dollars must be carried, as in Arabia, causing
chafes and inconvenience at night. Moreover it can scarcely be
called safe. In dangerous countries wary travelers will adopt
surer precautions.</p>

<p>A pair of common native khurjin or saddle-bags contained my
wardrobe, the "bed," readily rolled up into a bundle; and for a
medicine chest I bought a pea-green box with red and yellow
flowers, capable of standing falls from a camel twice a day.</p>

<p>The next step was to find out when the local steamer would
start for Cairo, and accordingly I betook myself to the Transit
Office. No vessel was advertised; I was directed to call every
evening till satisfied. At last the fortunate event took place: a
"weekly departure," which by-the-by had occurred once every
fortnight or so, was in order for the next day. I hurried to the
office, but did not reach it till past noon&mdash;the hour of idleness.
A little dark gentleman, so formed and dressed as exactly to
resemble a liver-and-tan bull-terrier, who with his heels on the
table was dozing, cigar in mouth, over the last Galignani, positively
refused after a time,&mdash;for at first he would not speak at
all,&mdash;to let me take my passage till three in the afternoon. I
inquired when the boat started, upon which he referred me, as I
had spoken bad Italian, to the advertisement. I pleaded inability
to read or write, whereupon he testily cried "Alle nove! alle
nove!" (At nine! at nine!) Still appearing uncertain, I drove
him out of his chair, when he rose with a curse and read "8
<span class="smcap">a.m.</span>" An unhappy Eastern, depending upon what he said,
would have been precisely one hour too late.</p>

<p>Thus were we lapsing into the real good old Indian style of
doing business. Thus Indicus orders his first clerk to execute
some commission; the senior, having "work" upon his hands,
sends a junior; the junior finds the sun hot, and passes on the
word to a "peon"; the peon charges a porter with the errand;
and the porter quietly sits or dozes in his place, trusting that
fate will bring him out of the scrape, but firmly resolved, though
the shattered globe fall, not to stir an inch.</p>

<p>The reader, I must again express a hope, will pardon the egotism
of these descriptions: my object is to show him how business
is carried on in these hot countries&mdash;business generally.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2896" name="page2896">2896</a></span>
For had I, instead of being Abdullah the Dervish, been a rich
native merchant, it would have been the same. How many complaints
of similar treatment have I heard in different parts of
the Eastern world! and how little can one realize them without
having actually experienced the evil! For the future I shall
never see a "nigger" squatting away half a dozen mortal hours
in a broiling sun, patiently waiting for something or for some
one, without a lively remembrance of my own cooling of the
<i>calces</i> at the custom-house of Alexandria.</p>

<p>At length, about the end of May, all was ready. Not without
a feeling of regret I left my little room among the white myrtle
blossoms and the oleander flowers. I kissed with humble ostentation
my kind host's hand in presence of his servants, bade
adieu to my patients, who now amounted to about fifty, shaking
hands with all meekly and with religious equality of attention,
and, mounted in a "trap" which looked like a cross between a
wheel-barrow and dog-cart, drawn by a kicking, jibbing, and
biting mule, I set out for the steamer.</p>

<h3><a name="EN_ROUTE" id="EN_ROUTE"></a>EN ROUTE</h3>

<p class="subtitle">From 'A Pilgrimage to El Medinah and Meccah'</p>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="dcap">At</span> 3 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> we left El Zaribah, traveling towards the S.W.,
and a wondrously picturesque scene met the eye. Crowds
hurried along, habited in the pilgrim garb, whose whiteness
contrasted strangely with their black skins, their newly
shaven heads glistening in the sun, and their long black hair
streaming in the wind. The rocks rang with shouts of "Labbayk!
Labbayk!" At a pass we fell in with the Wahhabis, accompanying
the Baghdad caravan, screaming "Here am I"; and
guided by a large loud kettle-drum, they followed in double file
the camel of a standard-bearer, whose green flag bore in huge
white letters the formula of the Moslem creed. They were wild-looking
mountaineers, dark and fierce, with hair twisted into
thin dalik or plaits: each was armed with a long spear, a matchlock,
or a dagger. They were seated upon coarse wooden saddles,
without cushions or stirrups, a fine saddle-cloth alone
denoting a chief. The women emulated the men; they either
guided their own dromedaries, or sitting in pillion, they clung<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2897" name="page2897">2897</a></span>
to their husbands; veils they disdained, and their countenances
certainly belonged not to a "soft sex." These Wahhabis were
by no means pleasant companions. Most of them were followed
by spare dromedaries, either unladen or carrying water-skins,
fodder, fuel, and other necessaries for the march. The beasts
delighted in dashing furiously through our file, which, being
colligated, was thrown each time into the greatest confusion.
And whenever we were observed smoking, we were cursed aloud
for infidels and idolaters.</p>

<p>Looking back at El Zaribah, soon after our departure, I saw
a heavy nimbus settle upon the hilltops, a sheet of rain being
stretched between it and the plain. The low grumbling of
thunder sounded joyfully in our ears. We hoped for a shower,
but were disappointed by a dust-storm, which ended with a few
heavy drops. There arose a report that the Bedouins had
attacked a party of Meccans with stones,&mdash;classical Arabian missiles,&mdash;and
the news caused men to look exceeding grave.</p>

<p>At 5 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> we entered the wide bed of the fiumara, down
which we were to travel all night. Here the country falls rapidly
towards the sea, as the increasing heat of the air, the direction
of the <ins class="correction" title="Standardized from 'watercourses'">water-courses</ins>, and signs of violence in the torrent-bed
show. The fiumara varies in breadth from 150 feet to three-quarters
of a mile; its course, I was told, is towards the southwest,
and it enters the sea near Jeddah. The channel is a
coarse sand, with here and there masses of sheet rock and
patches of thin vegetation.</p>

<p>At about half-past 5 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> we entered a suspicious-looking
place. On the right was a stony buttress, along whose base the
stream, when there is one, flows; and to this depression was our
road limited by the rocks and thorn-trees, which filled the other
half of the channel. The left side was a precipice, grim and
barren, but not so abrupt as its brother. Opposite us the way
seemed barred by piles of hills, crest rising above crest into the
far blue distance. Day still smiled upon the upper peaks, but
the lower slopes and the fiumara bed were already curtained
with gray sombre shade.</p>

<p>A damp seemed to fall upon our spirits as we approached this
Valley Perilous. I remarked with wonder that the voices of the
women and children sank into silence, and the loud Labbaykas
of the pilgrims were gradually stilled. Whilst still speculating
upon the cause of this phenomenon, it became apparent. A small<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2898" name="page2898">2898</a></span>
curl of smoke, like a lady's ringlet, on the summit of the right-hand
precipice, caught my eye, and simultaneous with the echoing
crack of the matchlock a high-trotting dromedary in front of
me rolled over upon the sands. A bullet had split his heart,
throwing his rider a goodly somerset of five or six yards.</p>

<p>Ensued terrible confusion; women screamed, children shrieked,
and men vociferated, each one striving with might and main to
urge his animal out of the place of death. But the road being
narrow, they only managed to jam the vehicles in a solid immovable
mass. At every matchlock shot a shudder ran through the
huge body, as when the surgeon's scalpel touches some more
sensitive nerve. The irregular horsemen, perfectly useless, galloped
up and down over the stones, shouting to and ordering
one another. The Pacha of the army had his carpet spread at
the foot of the left-hand precipice, and debated over his pipe
with the officers what ought to be done. No good genius whispered
"Crown the heights."</p>

<p>Then it was that the conduct of the Wahhabis found favor in
my eyes. They came up, galloping their camels,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Torrents less rapid and less rash.&mdash;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>with their elf-locks tossing in the wind, and their flaring matches
casting a strange lurid light over their features. Taking up a
position, one body began to fire upon the Utaybah robbers,
whilst two or three hundred, dismounting, swarmed up the hill
under the guidance of the Sherif Zayd. I had remarked this
nobleman at El Medinah as a model specimen of the pure Arab.
Like all Sherifs, he is celebrated for bravery, and has killed
many with his own hand. When urged at El Zaribah to ride
into Meccah, he swore that he would not leave the caravan till
in sight of the walls; and fortunately for the pilgrims, he kept
his word. Presently the firing was heard far in our rear&mdash;the
robbers having fled; the head of the column advanced, and the
dense body of the pilgrims opened out. Our forced halt was
now exchanged for a flight. It required much management to
steer our desert-craft clear of danger; but Shaykh Masud was
equal to the occasion. That many were lost was evident by the
boxes and baggage that strewed the shingles. I had no means
of ascertaining the number of men killed and wounded: reports
were contradictory, and exaggeration unanimous. The robbers
were said to be 150 in number; their object was plunder, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2899" name="page2899">2899</a></span>
they would eat the shot camels. But their principal ambition
was the boast "We, the Utaybah, on such and such a night
stopped the Sultan's mahmal one whole hour in the pass."</p>

<p>At the beginning of the skirmish I had primed my pistols,
and sat with them ready for use. But soon seeing that there
was nothing to be done, and wishing to make an impression,&mdash;nowhere
does Bobadil now "go down" but in the East,&mdash;I
called aloud for my supper. Shaykh Nur, exanimate with fear,
could not move. The boy Mohammed ejaculated only an "Oh,
sir!" and the people around exclaimed in disgust, "By Allah! he
eats!" Shaykh Abdullah, the Meccan, being a man of spirit,
was amused by the spectacle. "Are these Afghan manners,
Effendim?" he inquired from the shugduf behind me. "Yes," I
replied aloud, "in my country we always dine before an attack of
robbers, because that gentry is in the habit of sending men to
bed supperless." The Shaykh laughed aloud, but those around
him looked offended. I thought the bravado this time <i>mal placÃ©</i>;
but a little event which took place on my way to Jeddah proved
that it was not quite a failure.</p>

<p>As we advanced our escort took care to fire every large dry
asclepias, to disperse the shades which buried us. Again the
scene became wondrous wild:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Full many a waste I've wander'd o'er,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clomb many a crag, cross'd many a shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But, by my halidome,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A scene so rude, so wild as this,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet so sublime in barrenness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ne'er did my wandering footsteps press,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where'er I chanced to roam."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>On either side were ribbed precipices, dark, angry, and towering
above, till their summits mingled with the glooms of night;
and between them formidable looked the chasm, down which our
host hurried with shouts and discharges of matchlocks. The
torch-smoke and the night-fires of flaming asclepias formed a
canopy, sable above and livid red below, which hung over our
heads like a sheet, and divided the cliffs into two equal parts.
Here the fire flashed fiercely from a tall thorn, that crackled and
shot up showers of sparks into the air; there it died away in
lurid gleams, which lit up a truly Stygian scene. As usual, however,
the picturesque had its inconveniences. There was no<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2900" name="page2900">2900</a></span>
path. Rocks, stone-banks, and trees obstructed our passage. The
camels, now blind in darkness, then dazzled by a flood of light,
stumbled frequently; in some places slipping down a steep
descent, in others sliding over a sheet of mud. There were
furious quarrels and fierce language between camel-men and their
hirers, and threats to fellow-travelers; in fact, we were united in
discord. I passed that night crying "Hai! Hai!" switching the
camel, and fruitlessly endeavoring to fustigate Masud's nephew,
who resolutely slept upon the water-bags. During the hours of
darkness we made four or five halts, when we boiled coffee and
smoked pipes, but man and beasts were beginning to suffer from
a deadly fatigue.</p>

<p>Dawn found us still traveling down the fiumara, which here is
about one hundred yards broad. The granite hills on both sides
were less precipitous, and the borders of the torrent-bed became
natural quays of stiff clay, which showed a water-mark of from
twelve to fifteen feet in height. In many parts the bed was
muddy, and the moist places, as usual, caused accidents. I happened
to be looking back at Shaykh Abdullah, who was then
riding in old Ali bin Ya Sin's fine shugduf; suddenly the camel's
four legs disappeared from under him, his right side flattening
the ground, and the two riders were pitched severally out of the
smashed vehicle. Abdullah started up furious, and abused the
Bedouins, who were absent, with great zest. "Feed these Arabs,"
he exclaimed, quoting a Turkish proverb, "and they will fire at
Heaven!" But I observed that, when Shaykh Masud came up,
the citizen was only gruff.</p>

<p>We then turned northward, and sighted El Mazik, more generally
known as Wady Laymun, the Valley of Limes. On the
right bank of the fiumara stood the Meccan Sherif's state pavilion,
green and gold: it was surrounded by his attendants, and
prepared to receive the Pacha of the caravan. We advanced half
a mile, and encamped temporarily in a hill-girt bulge of the fiumara
bed. At 8 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> we had traveled about twenty-four miles
from El Zaribah, and the direction of our present station was
S.&nbsp;W. 50Â°.</p>

<p>Shaykh Masud allowed us only four hours' halt; he wished to
precede the main body. After breaking our fast joyously upon
limes, pomegranates, and fresh dates, we sallied forth to admire
the beauties of the place. We are once more on classic ground,
the ground of the ancient Arab poets:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page2901" name="page2901">2901</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Deserted is the village&mdash;waste the halting place and home<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At Mina; o'er Rijam and Ghul wild beasts unheeded roam;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On Rayyan hill the channel lines have left a naked trace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Time-worn, as <i>primal Writ that dints the mountains flinty face</i>;"&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and this wady, celebrated for the purity of its air, has from
remote ages been a favorite resort of the Meccans. Nothing can
be more soothing to the brain than the dark-green foliage of the
limes and pomegranates; and from the base of the southern
hill bursts a bubbling stream, whose</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Chiare, fresche e dolci acque"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>flow through the garden, filling them with the most delicious of
melodies, and the gladdest sound which nature in these regions
knows.</p>

<p>Exactly at noon Masud seized the halter of the foremost
camel, and we started down the fiumara. Troops of Bedouin
girls looked over the orchard walls laughingly, and children came
out to offer us fresh fruit and sweet water. At 2 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, traveling
southwest, we arrived at a point where the torrent-bed turns
to the right, and quitting it, we climbed with difficulty over a
steep ridge of granite. Before three o'clock we entered a hill-girt
plain, which my companions called "Sola." In some places
were clumps of trees, and scattered villages warned us that we
were approaching a city. Far to the left rose the blue peaks of
Taif, and the mountain road, a white thread upon the nearer
heights, was pointed out to me. Here I first saw the tree, or
rather shrub, which bears the balm of Gilead, erst so celebrated
for its tonic and stomachic properties. I told Shaykh to break
off a twig, which he did heedlessly. The act was witnessed by
our party with a roar of laughter, and the astounded Shaykh
was warned that he had become subject to an atoning sacrifice.
Of course he denounced me as the instigator, and I could not
fairly refuse assistance. The tree has of late years been carefully
described by many botanists; I will only say that the bark
resembled in color a cherry-stick pipe, the inside was a light
yellow, and the juice made my fingers stick together.</p>

<p>At 4 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> we came to a steep and rocky pass, up which we
toiled with difficulty. The face of the country was rising once
more, and again presented the aspect of numerous small basins
divided and surrounded by hills. As we jogged on we were
passed by the cavalcade of no less a personage than the Sherif<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2902" name="page2902">2902</a></span>
of Meccah. Abd el Muttalib bin Ghalib is a dark, beardless old
man with African features, derived from his mother. He was
plainly dressed in white garments and a white muslin turban,
which made him look jet-black; he rode an ambling mule, and
the only emblem of his dignity was the large green satin
umbrella borne by an attendant on foot. Scattered around him
were about forty matchlock-men, mostly slaves. At long intervals,
after their father, came his four sons, Riza Bey, Abdullah,
Ali, and Ahmed, the latter still a child. The three elder
brothers rode splendid dromedaries at speed; they were young
men of light complexion, with the true Meccan cast of features,
showily dressed in bright-colored silks, and armed, to denote
their rank, with sword and gold-hilted dagger.</p>

<p>We halted as evening approached, and strained our eyes, but
all in vain, to catch sight of Meccah, which lies in a winding
valley. By Shaykh Abdullah's direction I recited, after the
usual devotions, the following prayer. The reader is forewarned
that it is difficult to preserve the flowers of Oriental rhetoric in
a European tongue.</p>

<p>"O Allah! verily this is thy safeguard (Amn) and thy Sanctuary
(Haram)! Into it whoso entereth becometh safe (Amin).
So deny (Harrim) my flesh and blood, my bones and skin, to
hell-fire. O Allah! Save me from thy wrath on the day when
thy servants shall be raised from the dead. I conjure thee by
this that thou art Allah, besides whom is none (thou only), the
merciful, the compassionate. And have mercy upon our lord
Mohammed, and upon the progeny of our lord Mohammed, and
upon his followers, one and all!" This was concluded with the
"Talbiyat," and with an especial prayer for myself.</p>

<p>We again mounted, and night completed our disappointment.
About 1 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> I was aroused by general excitement. "Meccah!
Meccah!" cried some voices. "The Sanctuary! O the Sanctuary!"
exclaimed others; and all burst into loud "Labbayk," not unfrequently
broken by sobs. I looked out from my litter, and saw
by the light of the southern stars the dim outlines of a large
city, a shade darker than the surrounding plain. We were passing
over the last ridge by a "winding path" flanked on both
sides by watch-towers, which command the "Darb el Maala," or
road leading from the north into Meccah. Thence we passed
into the Maabidah (northern suburb), where the Sherif's palace
is built. After this, on the left hand, came the deserted abode<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2903" name="page2903">2903</a></span>
of the Sherif bin Aun, now said to be a "haunted house."<a name="Anchor-106" id="Anchor-106"></a><a title="Go to footnote 106" href="#Footnote-106" class="fnanchor">106</a> Opposite
to it lies the Jannat el Maala, the holy cemetery of Meccah.
Thence, turning to the right, we entered the Sulaymaniyah
or Afghan quarter. Here the boy Mohammed, being an inhabitant
of the Shamiyah or Syrian ward, thought proper to display
some apprehension. These two are on bad terms; children never
meet without exchanging volleys of stones, and men fight furiously
with quarter-staves. Sometimes, despite the terrors of
religion, the knife and sabre are drawn. But these hostilities
have their code. If a citizen be killed, there is a subscription
for blood-money. An inhabitant of one quarter, passing singly
through another, becomes a guest; once beyond the walls, he is
likely to be beaten to insensibility by his hospitable foes.</p>

<p>At the Sulaymaniyah we turned off the main road into a
by-way, and ascended by narrow lanes the rough heights of
Jebel Hindi, upon which stands a small whitewashed and crenellated
building called a "fort." Thence descending, we threaded
dark streets, in places crowded with rude cots and dusky figures,
and finally at 2 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> we found ourselves at the door of the boy
Mohammed's house.</p>

<p>We arrived on the morning of Sunday the 7th Zu'l Hijjah
(11th September, 1853), and had one day before the beginning of
the pilgrimage to repose and visit the Haram. From El Medinah
to Meccah the distance, according to my calculation, was 248
English miles, which was accomplished in eleven marches.</p>

same may have come to them filtered through the work of
others. Of these, Burton's 'Anatomy of Melancholy' is one of the
most marked instances. It is a vast storehouse from which subsequent
authors have always drawn and continue to draw, even as
Burton himself drew from others,&mdash;though without always giving the
credit which with him was customary. Few would now have the
courage to read it through, and probably
fewer still could say with Dr. Johnson that
it "was the only book that ever took him

<p class="caption smcap">Robert Burton</p>
</div>

<p>Of Robert Burton himself very little is
known. He was born in 1577, a few years
later than Shakespeare,&mdash;probably at Lindley,
in Leicestershire; and died at Oxford
in 1640. He had some schooling at Sutton
Coldfield in Warwickshire, and was sent to
Brasenose College at Oxford in 1593; was
elected a student at Christ Church College
in 1599, and took his degree of B.D. in
1614. He was then thirty-seven years of
age. Why he should have been so long in reaching his degree, does
not appear. Two years later he was presented by the Dean and
Chapter of Christ Church to the vicarage of St. Thomas in the suburbs
of Oxford. To this, about 1630, through presentation by George,
Lord Berkeley, was added the rectory of Segrave in Leicestershire,
and he retained both livings until his death. This is about the sum
and substance of his known history. Various legends remain regarding
him; as, that he was very good and jolly company, a most learned
scholar, very ready in quotations from the poets and classical authors,&mdash;and
indeed no reader of the 'Anatomy' could imagine otherwise.
Yet was he of a melancholy disposition, and it is said that "he composed
this book with a view of relieving his own melancholy, but
increased it to such a degree that nothing could make him laugh but
going to the foot-bridge and hearing the ribaldry of the bargemen,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2905" name="page2905">2905</a></span>
which rarely failed to throw him into a violent fit of laughter." He
says himself, "I write of melancholy, by being busie, to avoid melancholy."
He was expert in the calculation of nativities, and cast his
own horoscope; having determined in which, the time at which his
death should occur, it was afterward shrewdly believed that he took
measures to insure the fulfillment of the prophecy.</p>

<p>His life was almost wholly spent in his study at Oxford. He was
a wide and curious reader, and the book to the composition of which
he devoted himself quotes authorities without end. All was fish
which came to his net: divines, poets, astrologists, doctors, philosophers,
men of science, travelers, romancers&mdash;he draws from the
whole range of literature; and often page after page&mdash;scores and
hundreds of pages,&mdash;is filled with quotations, sometimes of two or
three words only, sometimes translated and sometimes not, an almost
inextricable network of facts, of fancies, and of phrases. He says:
"As those old Romans rob'd all the cities of the world, to set out
their bad-sited Rome, we skim off the cream of other men's wits,
pick the choice flowers of their till'd gardens to set out our own
steril plots."</p>

<p>Yet when he sets about it, his handling is steady and assured,
and he has distinctly the literary touch, as well as the marks of
genius; having a very great quaintness withal. The title of his
famous book is 'The Anatomy of Melancholy. What It Is, with All
the Kinds, Causes, Symptoms, Prognostics, and several Cures of it.
In three Partitions. With their several Sections, Members, and Sub-sections,
Philosophically, Medically, Historically Opened and Cut Up.
By Democritus Junior.' The first edition appears to have been
issued in 1621. He continued to modify and enlarge it from time to
time throughout his life; and for the sixth edition, which appeared
some years after his death, he prepared a long address to the reader,
describing his student life, accounting for his choice of subject, and
full of quaint fancies and scathing criticisms of the ill habits and
weaknesses of mankind.</p>

<p>"Melancholy" means with Burton <i>Melancholia</i>, but it means also
all sorts of insanity, and apparently all affections of the mind or
spirit, sane or insane. On the one hand he heaps up, in page after
page and chapter after chapter, all the horrid ills to which flesh is
heir, or which it cultivates for itself, and paints the world as a very
pandemonium of evil and outrage. And anon the air blows soft and
sweet, the birds sing, both brotherly love and domestic happiness
are possible, and</p>

<h3><a name="CONCLUSIONS_AS_TO_MELANCHOLY" id="CONCLUSIONS_AS_TO_MELANCHOLY"></a>CONCLUSIONS AS TO MELANCHOLY</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="dcap">Generally</span> thus much we may conclude of melancholy: that
it is most pleasant at first, I say, <i>mentis gratissimus error</i>,
a most delightsome humor, to be alone, dwell alone, walk
alone, meditate, lie in bed whole days, dreaming awake as it
were, and frame a thousand phantastical imaginations unto themselves.
They are never better pleased than when they are so
doing; they are in Paradise for the time, and cannot well endure
to be interrupt; with him in the Poet:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"&mdash;pol! me occidistis, amici,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Non servÃ¢stis, ait:"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>you have undone him, he complains, if you trouble him: tell him
what inconvenience will follow, what will be the event, all is one,
<i>canis ad vomitum</i>, 'tis so pleasant he cannot refrain. He may
thus continue peradventure many years by reason of a strong
temperature, or some mixture of business, which may divert
his cogitations: but at the last <i>lÃ¦sa imaginatio</i>, his phantasy is
crazed, &amp; now habituated to such toys, cannot but work still
like a fate; the Scene alters upon a sudden; Fear and Sorrow
supplant those pleasing thoughts, suspicion, discontent, and perpetual
anxiety succeed in their places; so little by little, by that
shoeing-horn of idleness, and voluntary solitariness, Melancholy
this feral fiend is drawn on, <i>et quantum vertice ad auras Ã†thereas,
tantum radice in Tartara tendit</i>; "extending up, by its
branches, so far towards Heaven, as, by its roots, it does down
towards Tartarus;" it was not so delicious at first, as now it is
bitter and harsh: a cankered soul macerated with cares and discontents,
<i>tÃ¦dium vitÃ¦</i>, impatience, agony, inconstancy, irresolution,
precipitate them unto unspeakable miseries. They cannot<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2907" name="page2907">2907</a></span>
endure company, light, or life itself, some unfit for action, and
the like. Their bodies are lean and dried up, withered, ugly;
their looks harsh, very dull, and their souls tormented, as they are
more or less entangled, as the humor hath been intended, or
according to the continuance of time they have been troubled.</p>

<p>To discern all which symptoms the better, <i>Rhasis</i> the <i>Arabian</i>
makes three degrees of them. The first is <i>falsa cogitatio</i>, false
conceits and idle thoughts: to misconstrue and amplify, aggravating
everything they conceive or fear: the second is <i>falso cogitatio
loqui</i>, to talk to themselves, or to use inarticulate incondite voices,
speeches, obsolete gestures, and plainly to utter their minds and
conceits of their hearts, by their words and actions, as to laugh,
weep, to be silent, not to sleep, eat their meat, &amp;c.; the third is
to put in practice that which they think or speak. <i>Savanarola,
Rub. II, Tract. 8, cap. 1, de Ã¦gritudine</i>, confirms as much: <i>when
he begins to express that in words, which he conceives in his heart,
or talks idly, or goes from one thing to another</i>, which <i>Gordonius</i>
calls <i>nec caput habentia nec caudam</i> [having neither head nor
tail], he is in the middle way: <i>but when he begins to act it likewise,
and to put his fopperies in execution, he is then in the extent
of melancholy, or madness itself.</i> This progress of melancholy
you shall easily observe in them that have been so affected, they
go smiling to themselves at first, at length they laugh out; at
first solitary, at last they can endure no company, or if they do,
they are now dizzards, past sense and shame, quite moped, they
care not what they say or do; all their actions, words, gestures,
are furious or ridiculous. At first his mind is troubled, he doth
not attend what is said, if you tell him a tale, he cries at last,
What said you? but in the end he mutters to himself, as old
women do many times, or old men when they sit alone; upon a
sudden they laugh, whoop, halloo, or run away, and swear they
see or hear Players, Devils, Hobgoblins, Ghosts, strike, or strut,
&amp;c., grow humorous in the end: like him in the Poet, <i>sÃ¦pe
ducentos sÃ¦pe decem servos</i> [he often keeps two hundred slaves,
often only ten], he will dress himself, and undress, careless at
last, grows insensible, stupid or mad. He howls like a wolf,
barks like a dog, and raves like <i>Ajax</i> and <i>Orestes</i>, hears Music
and outcries which no man else hears....</p>

<p>Who can sufficiently speak of these symptoms, or prescribe
rules to comprehend them? As <i>Echo</i> to the painter in <i>Ausonius</i>,
<i>vane</i>, <i>quid affectas</i>, &amp;c.&mdash;foolish fellow, what wilt? if you must<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2908" name="page2908">2908</a></span>
needs paint me, paint a voice, <i>et similem si vis pingere, pinge
sonum</i>; if you will describe melancholy, describe a phantastical
conceit, a corrupt imagination, vain thoughts and different, which
who can do? The four-and-twenty letters make no more variety
of words in divers languages, than melancholy conceits produce
diversity of symptoms in several persons. They are irregular,
obscure, various, so infinite, <i>Proteus</i> himself is not so diverse;
you may as well make the Moon a new coat, as a true character
of a melancholy man; as soon find the motion of a bird in the
air, as the heart of man, a melancholy man. They are so
confused, I say, diverse, intermixt with other diseases. As the
species be confounded (which I have shewed) so are the symptoms;
sometimes with headache, <i>cachexia</i>, dropsy, stone, (as you
may perceive by those several examples and illustrations, collected
by <i>Hildesheim, spicel. 2</i>,<i> Mercurialis, consil. 118, cap. 6 et 11</i>), with
headache, epilepsy, <i>priapismus</i> (<i>Trincavellius, consil. 12, lib. I, consil.
49</i>), with gout, <i>caninus appetitus</i> (<i>Montanus, consil. 26, &amp;c., 23,
234, 249</i>), with falling-sickness, headache, <i>vertigo</i>, <i>lycanthropia</i>,
<i>&amp;c.</i> (<i>J. CÃ¦sar Claudinus, consult. 4, consult. 89 et 116</i>), with
gout, agues, hÃ¦mrods, stone, &amp;c. Who can distinguish these
melancholy symptoms so intermixt with others, or apply them to
their several kinds, confine them into method? 'Tis hard I confess,
yet I have disposed of them as I could, and will descend to
particularize them according to their species. For hitherto I have
expatiated in more general lists or terms, speaking promiscuously
of such ordinary signs, which occur amongst writers. Not that
they are all to be found in one man, for that were to paint a
Monster or ChimÃ¦ra, not a man; but some in one, some in
another, and that successively, or at several times.</p>

<p>Which I have been the more curious to express and report, not
to upbraid any miserable man, or by way of derision (I rather pity
them), but the better to discern, to apply remedies unto them;
and to shew that the best and soundest of us all is in great
danger; how much we ought to fear our own fickle estates,
remember our miseries and vanities, examine and humiliate ourselves,
seek to God, and call to him for mercy, that needs not
look for any rods to scourge ourselves, since we carry them in
our bowels; and that our souls are in a miserable captivity, if
the light of grace and heavenly truth doth not shine continually
upon us; and by our discretion to moderate ourselves, to be more
circumspect and wary in the midst of these dangers.</p>

<h3><a name="HORACE_BUSHNELL" id="HORACE_BUSHNELL"></a>HORACE BUSHNELL</h3>

<p class="subtitle">(1802-1876)</p>

<p class="subtitle">BY THEODORE T. MUNGER</p>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/cap_h.png" title="" alt="H" width="74" height="75" class="cap" />
<p class="cap_1"><span class="dcap">Horace Bushnell</span> was born in 1802 in Litchfield, Connecticut,
and reared in New Preston, a hamlet near by. He was
graduated at Yale College in 1827, and after a year of
editorial service on the Journal of Commerce in New York he
became tutor in Yale College, studied theology at the same time,
and in 1833 was settled in the ministry over a Congregational church
in Hartford, Connecticut. He resigned his charge in 1853 on account
of ill health, but lived till 1876, filling the years to the last with
arduous study and authorship. He published
three volumes of sermons, two of
essays and addresses, a treatise on Women's
Suffrage, under the title 'A Reform
against Nature,' and five treatises of a
theological character. Each of the latter
was a distinct challenge to the prevailing
thought of his day, and involved him in
suspicion and accusation that well-nigh cost
him his ecclesiastical standing. It is now
generally acknowledged that he led the
way into the new world of theological
thought which has since opened so widely,
and thereby rendered great and enduring
service to the Christian faith.</p></div>

<p class="caption smcap">Horace Bushnell</p>
</div>

<p>It is enough to say of his work in this respect that it was characterized
by a mingling of the thought of the first three centuries,
and of the modern spirit which had found its way from Germany
into England through Coleridge. The two did not always agree
well, and the latter is the predominating feature in all his writings.
He was the first theologian in New England to admit fully into his
thought the modern sense of Nature, as it is found in the literature
of the early part of the century, and notably in Wordsworth and
Coleridge. Dr. Bushnell was not a student of this literature beyond
a thorough and sympathetic study of 'The Aids to Reflection,' but
through this open door the whole spirit of that great thought movement
entered his mind and found a congenial home. The secret of
this movement was a spiritual interpretation of nature. It was a step
in the evolution of human thought; and appearing first in literature,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2910" name="page2910">2910</a></span>
its natural point of entrance, it was sure to reach all forms of
thought, as in time to come it will reach all forms of social life.
The thing that the world is rapidly learning is, that not only is the
world God's but that God is in his world. Bushnell was by nature
immensely open to this thought, and its undertone can be heard in
almost every page of his writings. It was this that gave value to
his works and made them exceptional in his day and place. Each
of his great treatises is, with more or less distinctness, an effort to
put natural things and divine things into some sort of relevance and
oneness.</p>

<p>He took the path by which superior minds have always found
their way into new realms of truth. They do not pass from one
school to another, but instead rise into some new or some larger
conception of nature and start afresh. All gains in philosophy and
religion and civilization have been made by further inroads into
nature, and never in any other way. Dr. Bushnell, with the unerring
instinct of a discoverer, struck this path and kept it to the end.
At the bottom of all his work lies a profound sense of nature, of its
meaning and force in the realm of the spirit. He did not deny a
certain antithesis between nature and the supernatural, but he so
defined the latter that the two could be embraced in the one category
of nature when viewed as the ascertained order of God in creation.
The supernatural is simply the realm of freedom, and it is as
natural as the physical realm of necessity. Thus he not only got
rid of the traditional antinomy between them, but led the way into
that conception of the relation of God to his world which more and
more is taking possession of modern thought. In his essay on Language
he says (and the thought is always with him as a governing
principle):&mdash;"The whole universe of nature is a perfect analogon
of the whole universe of thought or spirit. Therefore, as nature
becomes truly a universe only through science revealing its universal
laws, the true universe of thought and spirit cannot sooner be conceived."
Thus he actually makes the revelation of spiritual truth
wait on the unfolding of the facts and laws of the world of nature.
There is something pathetic in the attitude of this great thinker sitting
in the dark, waiting for disclosures in nature that would substantiate
what he felt was true in the realm of the spirit. A
generation later he would have seen the light for which he longed&mdash;a
light that justifies the central point of all his main contentions.</p>

<p>His first and most important work, 'Christian Nurture,' contended
that the training of children should be according to nature,&mdash;not in
the poor sense of Rousseau, but that it should be divinely natural.
So 'Nature and the Supernatural,' whatever place may be accorded
to the book to-day, was an effort to bring the two terms that were<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2911" name="page2911">2911</a></span>
held as opposite and contradictory, into as close relation as God is to
his laws in nature. So in 'The Vicarious Sacrifice' his main purpose
was to take a doctrine that had been dwarfed out of its proper
proportions, and give to it the measure of God's love and the manner
of its action in human life. Dr. Bushnell may or may not have
thought with absolute correctness on these themes, but he thought
with consummate ability, he wrote with great eloquence and power,
and he left many pages that are to be cherished as literature, while
theologically they "point the way we are going."</p>

<p>One of the most characteristic and interesting things about Dr.
Bushnell is the method he took to find his way between this spiritual
view of things and that world of theological orthodoxy where he
stood by virtue of his profession. It was a very hard and dry world,&mdash;a
world chiefly of definitions,&mdash;but it covered vital realities, and so
must have had some connection with the other world. Dr. Bushnell
bridged the chasm by a theory of language which he regarded as
original with himself. It was not new, but he elaborated it in an
original way and with great ability. In its main feature it was simply
a claim to use in theology the symbolism of poetry; it regarded
language as something that attempts to make one feel the inexpressible
truth, rather than a series of definitions which imply that it can
be exactly stated in words; it held that truth is larger than any form
which attempts to express it; it images and reflects truth instead of
defining it.</p>

<p>This theory might be assumed without so long explication as he
gave, but it was greatly needed in the theological world, which at
that time was sunk in a sea of metaphysical definition, and consumed
with a lust for explaining everything in heaven and earth in terms
of alphabetic plainness. Dr. Bushnell was not only justified by the
necessity of his situation in resorting to his theory, but he had the
right which every man of genius may claim for himself. Any one
whose thought is broader than that about him, whose feeling is
deeper, whose imagination is loftier, is entitled to such a use of language
as shall afford him fullest expression; for he alone knows just
how much of thought, feeling, and imagination, how much of himself,
he puts into his words; they are coin whose value he himself
has a right to indicate by his own stamp. There is no pact with
others to use language in any given way, except upon some very
broad basis as to the main object of language. The first object is
not to secure definite and comprehensive understanding, but to give
expression, and to start thought which may lead to full understanding&mdash;as
the parable hides the thought until you think it out.</p>

<p>Dr. Bushnell's theory did not blind the ordinary reader. No writer
is more easily apprehended by the average mind if he has any sympathy
with the subjects treated; but it was an inconvenient thing<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2912" name="page2912">2912</a></span>
for his theological neighbors to manage. While they insisted on
"the evident meaning of the words,"&mdash;a mischievous phrase,&mdash;he
was breathing his meaning into attentive souls by the spirit which
he had contrived to hide within his words. It is a way that genius
has,&mdash;as Abt Vogler says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"But God has a few of us whom he whispers in the ear:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rest may reason and welcome: 'tis we musicians know."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The first thing that brought Dr. Bushnell out of the world of
theology into the world of literature was his oration before the Phi
Beta Kappa Society at Harvard College in 1848. He had achieved a
reputation as a preacher of remarkable insight for such as had ears
to hear, and he was already in the thick of theological controversy;
but his fine power of expression and breadth of thought had not been
specially noticed. This oration introduced him into the world of
letters. Mr. J.&nbsp;T. Fields&mdash;the most discerning critic of the day&mdash;said
to the writer that the oration was heard with surprise and
delight, and that it gave the speaker an assured place in the ranks
of literature. That he should have been so readily welcomed by the
literary guild is not strange, for the title of his oration&mdash;'Work and
Play'&mdash;led the way into a discussion of the secret that underlies all
works of genius. For once, the possessor of the divine gift heard its
secret revealed and himself explained to himself; his work was set
before him as the full play of his spirit. Beginning with nature,
where our author always began, and finding there a free and sportive
element, he carries it into human life; making the contention that its
aim should be, and that its destiny will be, to free itself from the
constraint of mere work and rise into that natural action of the
faculties which may be called <i>play</i>&mdash;a moral and spiritual process.
His conclusion is <span class="nowrap">that&mdash;</span></p>

<blockquote><p>"if the world were free,&mdash;free, I mean, of themselves; brought up, all, out of
work into the pure inspiration of truth and charity,&mdash;new forms of personal
and intellectual beauty would appear, and society itself reveal the Orphic
movement. No more will it be imagined that poetry and rhythm are accidents
or figments of the race, one side of all ingredient or ground of nature.
But we shall know that poetry is the real and true state of man; the proper
and last ideal of souls, the free beauty they long for, and the rhythmic flow
of that universal play in which all life would live."</p></blockquote>

<p>The key to Dr. Bushnell is to be found in this passage, and it is
safe to say of him that in hardly a page of a dozen volumes is he
false to it. He is always a poet, singing out of "the pure inspiration
of truth and charity," and keeping ever in mind that poetry and
rhythm are not figments outside of nature, but the real and true
state of man and the proper and last ideal of souls.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page2913" name="page2913">2913</a></span>
The centrality of this thought is seen in his style. It is a
remarkable style, and is only to be appreciated when the man is
understood. It is made up of long sentences full of qualifying
phrases until the thought is carved into perfect exactness; or&mdash;changing
the figure&mdash;shade upon shade is added until the picture and
conception are alike. But with all this piling up of phrases, he
not only did not lose proportion and rhythm, but so set down his
words that they read like a chant and sound like the breaking of
waves upon the beach. Nor does he ever part with poetry in the
high sense in which he conceived it. I will not compare his style,
as to merit, with that of Milton and Jeremy Taylor and Sir Thomas
Browne, but he belongs to their class; he has the same majestic
swing, and like them he cannot forbear singing, whatever he may
have to say. His theme may be roads, or city plans, or agriculture,
or emigration, or the growth of law; yet he never fails of lifting his
subject into that higher world of the imagination where the real
truth of the subject is to be found, and is made to appear as poetry.
It would be unjust to identify him so thoroughly with the poets if it
should lead to the thought that he was not a close and rigorous
thinker. It should not be forgotten that all great prose-writers,
from Plato down to Carlyle and Emerson, stand outside of poetry
only by virtue of their form and not by virtue of their thought;
indeed, poet and thinker are interchangeable names. Dr. Bushnell
wrote chiefly on theology, and the value and efficacy of his writings
lie in the fact that imagination and fact, thought and sentiment,
reason and feeling, are each preserved and yet so mingled as to
make a single impression.</p>

<p>This combination of two realms or habits of thought appears on
every page. He was, as Novalis said of Spinoza, "A God-intoxicated
man," but it was God as containing humanity in himself. His
theology was a veritable Jacob's ladder, on which the angels of God
ascend and descend; and if in his thought they descended before
they ascended, it was because he conceived of humanity as existing
in God before it was manifest in creation; and if his head was among
the stars, his feet were always firmly planted on the earth. This
twofoldness finds a curious illustration in the sub-titles of several of
his books. 'The Vicarious Sacrifice' does not spring alone out of
the divine nature, but is 'Grounded in Principles of Universal Obligation.'
'Nature and the Supernatural'&mdash;the great antithesis in
theology&mdash;constitute 'The One System of God.' 'Women's Suffrage'
is 'The Reform against Nature'&mdash;the best book, I must be permitted
to say, on either side of this much-debated question.</p>

<p>It is a popular impression of Dr. Bushnell that he was the subject
of his imagination, and that it ran away with him in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2914" name="page2914">2914</a></span>
treatment of themes which required only severe thought: the impression
is a double mistake: theology does not call for severe thought,
alone nor mainly; but first and chiefly for the imagination, and the
seeing and interpreting eye that usually goes with it; its object is to
find spirit under form, to discover what the <i>logos</i> expresses. For this
the imagination is the chief requisite. It is not a vagrant and
irresponsible faculty, but an inner eye whose vision is to be trusted
like that of the outer; it has in itself the quality of thought, and is
not a mere picture-making gift. Dr. Bushnell trained his imagination
to work on certain definite lines, and for a definite end&mdash;namely,
to bring out the spiritual meaning hidden within the external
form. He worked in the spirit of Coleridge's words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">"I had found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That outward forms the loftiest, still receive<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their finer influence from the Life within."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>No analysis or recapitulation of his works can be given in these
preliminary words. Perhaps his most influential book is the first,
'Christian Nurture'; while a treatise for the household, it was
surcharged with theological opinions which proved to be revolutionary
and epoch-making. 'The Vicarious Sacrifice' has most
affected the pulpit. 'Nature and the Supernatural,' the tenth
chapter of which has become a classic, has done great service in
driving out the extreme dualism that invested the subject of God's
relation to creation. His ablest essay is the treatise on Language;
the most literary is that on 'Work and Play'; the most penetrating
in its insight is 'Our Gospel a Gift to the Imagination'; the most
personal and characteristic is 'The Age of Homespun.' His best
sermon is always the one last read; and they are perhaps his most
representative work. The sermon is not usually ranked as belonging
to literature, but no canon excludes those preached by this great
man. They are timeless in their truth, majestic in their diction,
commanding in their moral tone, penetrating in their spirituality,
and pervaded by that quality without which a sermon is not one&mdash;the
divine uttering itself to the human. There is no striving and
crying in the streets, no heckling of saints nor dooming of sinners,
no petty debates over details of conduct, no dogmatic assumption,
no logical insistence, but only the gentle and mighty persuasions of
truth, coming as if breathed by the very spirit of God.</p>

<p>Language was to him "the sanctuary of thought," and these
sermons are the uttered worship in that temple where reason and
devotion are one.</p>

<h3><a name="WORK_AND_PLAY" id="WORK_AND_PLAY"></a>WORK AND PLAY</h3>

<p class="subtitle">From 'Work and Play'</p>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="dcap">Let</span> me call to my aid, then, some thoughtful spirit in my
audience: not a poet, of necessity, or a man of genius, but
a man of large meditation, one who is accustomed to
observe, and, by virtue of the warm affinities of a living heart,
to draw out the meanings that are hid so often in the humblest
things. Returning into the bosom of his family in some interval
of care and labor, he shall come upon the very unclassic and
certainly unimposing scene,&mdash;his children and a kitten playing
on the floor together; and just there, possibly, shall meet him
suggestions more fresh and thoughts of higher reach concerning
himself and his race, than the announcement of a new-discovered
planet or the revolution of an empire would incite. He surveys
with a meditative feeling this beautiful scene of muscular play,&mdash;the
unconscious activity, the exuberant life, the spirit of glee,&mdash;and
there rises in his heart the conception that possibly he is
here to see the prophecy or symbol of another and higher kind
of play, which is the noblest exercise and last end of man
himself. Worn by the toils of years, perceiving with a sigh
that the unconscious joy of motion here displayed is spent in
himself, and that now he is effectually tamed to the doom of a
working creature, he may yet discover, in the lively sympathy
with play that bathes his inward feeling, that his soul is playing
now,&mdash;enjoying, without the motions, all it could do in them;
manifold more than it could if he were down upon the floor
himself, in the unconscious activity and lively frolic of childhood.
Saddened he may be to note how time and work have changed
his spirit and dried away the playful springs of animal life in his
being; yet he will find, or ought, a joy playing internally over
the face of his working nature, which is fuller and richer as it is
more tranquil; which is to the other as fulfillment to prophecy,
and is in fact the prophecy of a better and far more glorious
fulfillment still.</p>

<p>Having struck in this manner the great world-problem of
<span class="smcap">work and play</span>, his thoughts kindle under the theme, and he
pursues it. The living races are seen at a glance to be offering
in their history everywhere a faithful type of his own. They
show him what he himself is doing and preparing&mdash;all that he<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2916" name="page2916">2916</a></span>
finds in the manifold experience of his own higher life. They
have, all, their gambols; all, their sober cares and labors. The
lambs are sporting on the green knoll; the anxious dams are
bleating to recall them to their side. The citizen beaver is
building his house by a laborious carpentry; the squirrel is lifting
his sail to the wind on the swinging top of the tree. In the
music of the morning, he hears the birds playing with their
voices, and when the day is up, sees them sailing round in
circles on the upper air, as skaters on a lake, folding their wings,
dropping and rebounding, as if to see what sport they can make
of the solemn laws that hold the upper and lower worlds
together. And yet these play-children of the air he sees again
descending to be carriers and drudges; fluttering and screaming
anxiously about their nest, and confessing by that sign that not
even wings can bear them clear of the stern doom of work. Or,
passing to some quiet shade, meditating still on this careworn
life, playing still internally with ideal fancies and desires unrealized,
there returns upon him there, in the manifold and
spontaneous mimicry of nature, a living show of all that is
transpiring in his own bosom; in every flower some bee humming
over his laborious chemistry and loading his body with the
fruits of his toil; in the slant sunbeam, populous nations of
motes quivering with animated joy, and catching, as in play, at
the golden particles of the light with their tiny fingers. Work
and play, in short, are the universal ordinance of God for the
living races; in which they symbolize the fortune and interpret
the errand of man. No creature lives that must not work and
may not play.</p>

<p>Returning now to himself and to man, and meditating yet
more deeply, as he is thus prepared to do, on work and play,
and play and work, as blended in the compound of our human
life; asking again what is work and what is play, what are the
relations of one to the other, and which is the final end of all,
he discovers in what he was observing round him a sublimity
of import, a solemnity even, that is deep as the shadow of
eternity.</p>

<p>I believe in a future age yet to be revealed, which is to be
distinguished from all others as the godly or godlike age,&mdash;an
age not of universal education simply, or universal philanthropy,
or external freedom, or political well-being, but a day of reciprocity
and free intimacy between all souls and God. Learning<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2917" name="page2917">2917</a></span>
and religion, the scholar and the Christian, will not be divided
as they have been. The universities will be filled with a profound
spirit of religion, and the <i>bene orÃ¢sse</i> will be a fountain of
inspiration to all the investigations of study and the creations of
genius.</p>

<p>I raise this expectation of the future, not because some
prophet of old time has spoken of a day to come when "the
streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in the
streets thereof" (for I know not that he meant to be so interpreted),
but because I find a prophecy of play in our nature
itself which it were a violation of all insight not to believe will
sometime be fulfilled. And when it is fulfilled it will be found
that Christianity has at last developed a new literary era, the
era of religious love.</p>

<p>Hitherto the passion of love has been the central fire of the
world's literature. The dramas, epics, odes, novels, and even
histories, have spoken to the world's heart chiefly through this
passion, and through this have been able to get their answer.
For this passion is a state of play, wherein the man loses himself
in the ardor of a devotion regardless of interest, fear, care,
prudence, and even of life itself. Hence there gathers round the
lover a tragic interest, and we hang upon his destiny as if some
natural charm or spell were in it. Now this passion of love,
which has hitherto been the staple of literature, is only a crude
symbol in the life of nature, by which God designs to interpret,
and also to foreshadow, the higher love of religion,&mdash;nature's
gentle Beatrice, who puts her image in the youthful Dante, by
that to attend him afterwards in the spirit-flight of song, and be
his guide up through the wards of Paradise to the shining mount
of God. What then are we to think, but that God will sometime
bring us up out of the literature of the lower love, into
that of the higher?&mdash;that as the age of passion yields to the age
of reason, so the crude love of instinct will give place to the
loftier, finer, more impelling love of God? And then around
that nobler love, or out of it, shall arise a new body of literature,
as much more gifted as the inspiration is purer and more
intellectual. Beauty, truth, and worship; song, science, and duty,
will all be unfolded together in this common love.</p>

<h3><a name="FROM_THE_AGE_OF_HOMESPUN" id="FROM_THE_AGE_OF_HOMESPUN"></a>FROM 'THE AGE OF HOMESPUN'</h3>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="dcap">Most</span> of all to be remembered are those friendly circles gathered
so often round the winter's fire; not the stove, but
the fire, the brightly blazing, hospitable fire. In the early
dusk, the home circle is drawn more closely and quietly round it;
but a good neighbor and his wife drop in shortly from over the
way, and the circle begins to spread. Next, a few young folk from
the other end of the village, entering in brisker mood, find as
many more chairs set in as wedges into the periphery to receive
them also. And then a friendly sleighful of old and young that
have come down from the hill to spend an hour or two, spread
the circle again, moving it still farther back from the fire; and
the fire blazes just as much higher and more brightly, having a
new stick added for every guest. There is no restraint, certainly
no affectation of style. They tell stories, they laugh, they sing.
They are serious and gay by turns, or the young folks go on
with some play, while the fathers and mothers are discussing
some hard point of theology in the minister's last sermon, or
perhaps the great danger coming to sound morals from the multiplication
of turnpikes and newspapers! Meantime the good
housewife brings out her choice stock of home-grown exotics,
gathered from three realms&mdash;doughnuts from the pantry, hickory-nuts
from the chamber, and the nicest, smoothest apples from
the cellar; all which, including, I suppose I must add, the rather
unpoetic beverage that gave its acid smack to the ancient hospitality,
are discussed as freely, with no fear of consequences.
And then, as the tall clock in the corner of the room ticks on
majestically towards nine, the conversation takes, it may be, a
little more serious turn, and it is suggested that a very happy
evening may fitly be ended with a prayer. Whereupon the
circle breaks up with a reverent, congratulative look on every
face, which is itself the truest language of a social nature blessed
in human fellowship.</p>

<p>Such, in general, was the society of the homespun age....</p>

<p>Passing to the church, or rather I should say, to the meeting-house&mdash;good
translation, whether meant or not, of what is older
and more venerable than <i>church</i>, viz., <i>synagogue</i>&mdash;here again
you meet the picture of a sturdy homespun worship. Probably
it stands on some hill, midway between three or four valleys,
whither the tribes go up to worship, and, when the snow-drifts<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2919" name="page2919">2919</a></span>
are deepest, go literally from strength to strength. There is no
furnace or stove save the foot-stoves that are filled from the fires
of the neighboring houses, and brought in partly as a rather
formal compliment to the delicacy of the tender sex, and sometimes
because they are really wanted. The dress of the assembly
is mostly homespun, indicating only slight distinctions of quality
in the worshipers. They are seated according to age,&mdash;the old
king Lemuels and their queens in front, near the pulpit, and the
younger Lemuels farther back, inclosed in pews, sitting back to
back, impounded, all, for deep thought and spiritual digestion;
only the deacons, sitting close under the pulpit by themselves,
to receive, as their distinctive honor, the more perpendicular
droppings of the Word. Clean round the front of the gallery is
drawn a single row of choir, headed by the key-pipe in the
centre. The pulpit is overhung by an august wooden canopy
called a sounding-board&mdash;study general, of course, and first lesson
of mystery to the eyes of the children, until what time their ears
are opened to understand the spoken mysteries.</p>

<p>There is no affectation of seriousness in the assembly, no
mannerism of worship; some would say too little of the manner
of worship. They think of nothing, in fact, save what meets
their intelligence and enters into them by that method. They
appear like men who have a digestion for strong meat, and have
no conception that trifles more delicate can be of any account to
feed the system. Nothing is dull that has the matter in it,
nothing long that has not exhausted the matter. If the minister
speaks in his great-coat and thick gloves or mittens, if the howling
blasts of winter drive in across the assembly fresh streams of
ventilation that move the hair upon their heads, they are none
the less content, if only he gives them good strong exercise.
Under their hard and, as some would say, stolid faces, great
thoughts are brewing, and these keep them warm. Free-will,
fixed fate, foreknowledge absolute, trinity, redemption, special
grace, eternity&mdash;give them anything high enough, and the
tough muscle of their inward man will be climbing sturdily into
it; and if they go away having something to think of, they have
had a good day. A perceptible glow will kindle in their hard
faces only when some one of the chief apostles, a Day, a Smith,
or a Bellamy, has come to lead them up some higher pinnacle of
thought or pile upon their sturdy minds some heavier weight of
argument&mdash;fainting never under any weight, even that which, to<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2920" name="page2920">2920</a></span>
the foreign critics of the discourses preached by them and others
of their day, it seems impossible for any, the most cultivated
audience in the world, to have supported. These royal men of
homespun&mdash;how great a thing to them was religion!</p>

<p>The sons and daughters grew up, all, as you will perceive, in
the closest habits of industry. The keen jocky way of whittling
out a living by small bargains sharply turned, which many suppose
to be an essential characteristic of the Yankee race, is yet
no proper inbred distinction, but only a casual result, or incident,
that pertains to the transition period between the small, stringent
way of life in the previous times of home-production and the
new age of trade. In these olden times, these genuine days of
homespun, they supposed, in their simplicity, that thrift represented
work, and looked about seldom for any more delicate and
sharper way of getting on. They did not call a man's property
his <i>fortune</i>, but they spoke of one or another as being <i>worth</i> so
much; conceiving that he had it laid up as the reward or fruit
of his deservings. The house was a factory on the farm, the
farm a grower and producer for the house. The exchanges went
on briskly enough, but required neither money nor trade. No
affectation of polite living, no languishing airs of delicacy and
softness indoors, had begun to make the fathers and sons impatient
of hard work out of doors, and set them at contriving some
easier and more plausible way of living. Their very dress represented
work, and they went out as men whom the wives and
daughters had dressed for work; facing all weather, cold and
hot, wet and dry, wrestling with the plow on the stony-sided
hills, digging out the rocks by hard lifting and a good many
very practical experiments in mechanics, dressing the flax, threshing
the rye, dragging home, in the deep snows, the great
woodpile of the year's consumption; and then when the day is
ended&mdash;having no loose money to spend in taverns&mdash;taking
their recreation all together in reading or singing or happy
talk or silent looking in the fire, and finally in sleep&mdash;to rise
again with the sun and pray over the family Bible for just such
another good day as the last. And so they lived, working out,
each year, a little advance of thrift, just within the line of
comfort.</p>

<p>No mode of life was ever more expensive: it was life at the
expense of labor too stringent to allow the highest culture and
the most proper enjoyment. Even the dress of it was more<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2921" name="page2921">2921</a></span>
expensive than we shall ever see again. Still it was a life of
honesty and simple content and sturdy victory. Immoralities
that rot down the vigor and humble the consciousness of families
were as much less frequent as they had less thought of adventure;
less to do with travel and trade and money, and were closer
to nature and the simple life of home.</p>

<p>It was also a great point, in this homespun mode of life, that
it imparted exactly what many speak of only with contempt&mdash;a
closely girded habit of economy. Harnessed all together into
the producing process, young and old, male and female, from
the boy that rode the plow-horse to the grandmother knitting
under her spectacles, they had no conception of squandering
lightly what they all had been at work, thread by thread and
grain by grain, to produce. They knew too exactly what everything
cost, even small things, not to husband them carefully.
Men of patrimony in the great world, therefore, noticing their
small way in trade or expenditure, are ready, as we often see,
to charge them with meanness&mdash;simply because they knew things
only in the small; or, what is not far different, because they
were too simple and rustic to have any conception of the big
operations by which other men are wont to get their money
without earning it, and lavish the more freely because it was
not earned. Still, this knowing life only in the small, it will be
found, is really anything but meanness.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_FOUNDERS" id="THE_FOUNDERS"></a>THE FOUNDERS</h3>

<p class="subtitle">From 'Work and Play'</p>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="dcap">There</span> is a class of writers and critics in our country, who
imagine it is quite clear that our fathers cannot have been
the proper founders of our American liberties, because it is
in proof that they were so intolerant and so clearly unrepublican
often in their avowed sentiments. They suppose the world to be
a kind of professor's chair, and expect events to transpire logically
in it. They see not that casual opinions, or conventional and
traditional prejudices, are one thing, and that principles and
morally dynamic forces are often quite another; that the former
are the connectives only of history, the latter its springs of life;
and that if the former serve well enough as providential guards
and moderating weights overlying the deep geologic fires and<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2922" name="page2922">2922</a></span>
subterranean heavings of the new moral instincts below, these
latter will assuredly burst up at last in strong mountains of
rock, to crest the world. Unable to conceive such a truth, they
cast about them accordingly to find the paternity of our American
institutions in purely accidental causes. We are clear of
aristocratic orders, they say, because there was no blood of which
to make an aristocracy; independent of king and parliament,
because we grew into independence under the natural effects of
distance and the exercise of a legislative power; republican,
because our constitutions were cast in the molds of British law;
a wonder of growth in riches, enterprise, and population, because
of the hard necessities laid upon us, and our simple modes
of life.</p>

<p>There is yet another view of this question, that has a far
higher significance. We do not understand, as it seems to me,
the real greatness of our institutions when we look simply at the
forms under which we hold our liberties. It consists not in
these, but in the magnificent possibilities that underlie these
forms as their fundamental supports and conditions. In these
we have the true paternity and spring of our institutions; and
these, beyond a question, are the gift of our founders.</p>

<p>We see this, first of all, in the fixed relation between freedom
and intelligence, and the remarkable care they had of popular
education. It was not their plan to raise up a body of republicans.
But they believed in mind as in God. Their religion was
the choice of mind. The gospel they preached must have minds
to hear it; and hence the solemn care they had, even from the
first day of their settlement, of the education of every child.
And, as God would have it, the children whom they trained up
for pillars in the church turned out also to be more than tools of
power. They grew up into magistrates, leaders of the people,
debaters of right and of law, statesmen, generals, and signers of
declarations for liberty. Such a mass of capacity had never been
seen before in so small a body of men. And this is the first
condition of liberty&mdash;the Condensation of Power. For liberty is
not the license of an hour; it is not the butchery of a royal
house, or the passion that rages behind a barricade, or the caps
that are swung or the <i>vivas</i> shouted at the installing of a liberator.
But it is the compact, impenetrable matter of much manhood,
the compressed energy of good sense and public reason,
having power to see before and after and measure action by<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2923" name="page2923">2923</a></span>
counsel&mdash;this it is that walls about the strength and liberty of a
people. To be free is not to fly abroad as the owls of the night
when they take the freedom of the air, but it is to settle and
build and be strong&mdash;a commonwealth as much better compacted
in the terms of reason, as it casts off more of the restraints
of force.</p>

<p>Their word was "Reformation"&mdash;"the completion of the
Reformation"; not Luther's nor Calvin's, they expressly say;
they cannot themselves imagine it. Hitherto it is unconceived
by men. God must reveal it in the light that breaks forth from
him. And this he will do in his own good time. It is already
clear to us that, in order to any further progress in this
direction, it was necessary for a new movement to begin that
should loosen the joints of despotism and emancipate the mind
of the world. And in order to this a new republic must be
planted and have time to grow. It must be seen rising up in
the strong majesty of freedom and youth, outstripping the old
prescriptive world in enterprise and the race of power, covering
the ocean with its commerce, spreading out in populous swarms
of industry,&mdash;planting, building, educating, framing constitutions,
rushing to and fro in the smoke and thunder of travel along its
mighty rivers, across its inland seas, over its mountain-tops from
one shore to the other, strong in order as in liberty,&mdash;a savage
continent become the field of a colossal republican empire, whose
name is a name of respect and a mark of desire to the longing
eyes of mankind. And then, as the fire of new ideas and hopes
darts electrically along the nerves of feeling in the millions of the
race, it will be seen that a new Christian movement also begins
with it. Call it reformation, or formation, or by whatever name,
it is irresistible because it is intangible. In one view it is only
destruction. The State is loosened from the Church. The Church
crumbles down into fragments. Superstition is eaten away by
the strong acid of liberty, and spiritual despotism flies affrighted
from the broken loyalty of its metropolis. Protestantism also,
divided and subdivided by its dialectic quarrels, falls into the
finest, driest powder of disintegration. Be not afraid. The new
order crystallizes only as the old is dissolved; and no sooner is
the old unity of orders and authorities effectually dissolved than
the reconstructive affinities of a new and better unity begin to
appear in the solution. Repugnances melt away. Thought
grows catholic. Men look for good in each other as well as<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2924" name="page2924">2924</a></span>
evil. The crossings of opinion by travel and books, and the
intermixture of races and religions, issue in freer, broader views
of the Christian truth; and so the "Church of the Future," as it
has been called, gravitates inwardly towards those terms of
brotherhood in which it may coalesce and rest. I say not or
believe that Christendom will be Puritanized or Protestantized;
but what is better than either, it will be Christianized. It will
settle thus into a unity, probably not of form, but of practical
assent and love&mdash;a Commonwealth of the Spirit, as much
stronger in its unity than the old satrapy of priestly despotism,
as our republic is stronger than any other government of the
world.</p>

<h3><a name="RELIGIOUS_MUSIC" id="RELIGIOUS_MUSIC"></a>RELIGIOUS MUSIC</h3>

<p class="subtitle">From 'Work and Play'</p>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="dcap">As we</span> are wont to argue the invisible things of God, even his
eternal power and Godhead, from the things that are seen,
finding them all images of thought and vehicles of intelligence,
so we have an argument for God more impressive, in one
view, because the matter of it is so deep and mysterious, from
the fact that a grand, harmonic, soul-interpreting law of music
pervades all the objects of the material creation, and that things
without life, all metals and woods and valleys and mountains and
waters, are tempered with distinctions of sound, and toned to be
a language to the feeling of the heart. It is as if God had
made the world about us to be a grand organ of music, so that
our feelings might have play in it, as our understanding has in
the light of the sun and the outward colors and forms of things.
What is called the musical scale, or octave, is fixed in the original
appointments of sound just as absolutely and definitely as
the colors of the rainbow or prism in the optical properties and
laws of light. And the visible objects of the world are not
more certainly shaped and colored to us under the exact laws
of light and the prism, than they are tempered and toned,
as objects audible, to give distinctions of sound by their vibrations
in the terms of the musical octave. It is not simply that
we hear the sea roar and the floods clap their hands in anthems
of joy; it is not that we hear the low winds sigh, or the storms
howl dolefully, or the ripples break peacefully on the shore, or<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2925" name="page2925">2925</a></span>
the waters dripping sadly from the rock, or the thunders crashing
in horrible majesty through the pavements of heaven; not
only do all the natural sounds we hear come to us in tones of
music as interpreters of feeling, but there is hid in the secret
temper and substance of all matter a silent music, that only
waits to sound and become a voice of utterance to the otherwise
unutterable feeling of our heart&mdash;a voice, if we will have it, of
love and worship to the God of all.</p>

<p>First, there is a musical scale in the laws of the air itself,
exactly answering to the musical sense or law of the soul.
Next, there is in all substances a temperament of quality related
to both; so that whatever kind of feeling there may be in
a soul&mdash;war and defiance, festivity and joy, sad remembrance,
remorse, pity, penitence, self-denial, love, adoration&mdash;may find
some fit medium of sound in which to express itself. And, what
is not less remarkable, connected with all these forms of substances
there are mathematical laws of length and breadth, or
definite proportions of each, and reflective angles, that are every
way as exact as those which regulate the colors of the prism,
the images of the mirror, or the telescopic light of astronomic
worlds&mdash;mathematics for the heart as truly as for the head.</p>

<p>It cannot be said that music is a human creation, and as far
as the substances of the world are concerned, a mere accident.
As well can it be said that man creates the colors of the prism,
and that they are not in the properties of the light, because he
shapes the prism by his own mechanical art. Or if still we
doubt; if it seems incredible that the soul of music is in the heart
of all created being; then the laws of harmony themselves shall
answer, one string vibrating to another, when it is not struck
itself, and uttering its voice of concord simply because the concord
is in it and it feels the pulses on the air to which it cannot
be silent. Nay, the solid mountains and their giant masses of
rock shall answer; catching, as they will, the bray of horns or
the stunning blast of cannon, rolling it across from one top to
another in reverberating pulses, till it falls into bars of musical
rhythm and chimes and cadences of silver melody. I have heard
some fine music, as men are wont to speak&mdash;the play of orchestras,
the anthems of choirs, the voices of song that moved admiring
nations. But in the lofty passes of the Alps I heard a music
overhead from God's cloudy orchestra, the giant peaks of rock
and ice, curtained in by the driving mist and only dimly visible<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2926" name="page2926">2926</a></span>
athwart the sky through its folds, such as mocks all sounds our
lower worlds of art can ever hope to raise. I stood (excuse the
simplicity) calling to them, in the loudest shouts I could raise,
even till my power was spent, and listening in compulsory trance
to their reply. I heard them roll it up through their cloudy
worlds of snow, sifting out the harsh qualities that were tearing
in it as demon screams of sin, holding on upon it as if it were a
hymn they were fining to the ear of the great Creator, and sending
it round and round in long reduplications of sweetness, minute
after minute; till finally receding and rising, it trembled, as it
were, among the quick gratulations of angels, and fell into the
silence of the pure empyrean. I had never any conception before
of what is meant by <i>quality</i> in sound. There was more power
upon the soul in one of those simple notes than I ever expect to
feel from anything called music below, or ever can feel till I
hear them again in the choirs of the angelic world. I had never
such a sense of purity, or of what a simple sound may tell of
purity by its own pure quality; and I could not but say, O my
God, teach me this! Be this in me forever! And I can truly
affirm that the experience of that hour has consciously made me
better able to think of God ever since&mdash;better able to worship.
All other sounds are gone; the sounds of yesterday, heard in the
silence of enchanted multitudes, are gone; but that is with me
still, and I hope will never cease to ring in my spirit till I go
down to the slumber of silence itself.</p>

wit." The Clerk of the Admiralty had connections at court; and
between that February morning and a December day when Mr.
Battersby was at the Wardrobe using the King's time in gossip
about the new book of drollery, the merry
Stuart had found out Sam Butler's poem
and had given it the help of his royal
approval. Erstwhile, Samuel the courtier
had thought the work of Samuel the poet
silly, and had given warranty of his opinion
by suffering loss of one shilling eightpence
on his purchase of the book. A view not
to be wondered at in one who sets down
"Midsummer Night's Dream" as "insipid
and ridiculous," and "Othello" as a "mean
thing"! Perhaps it was because Butler had
a keen knowledge of Shakespeare, and unconsciously
used much of the actor's quick-witted
method, that his delicately feathered
barbs made no dent on the hard head of Pepys. Like his neighbor
of the Avon, the author of "Hudibras" was a merciless scourge to
the vainglorious follies of the time in which he poorly and obscurely
lived; and like the truths which he told in his inimitable satires, the
virtue and decency of his life was obscured by the disorder of the
Commonwealth and the unfaith of the restored monarchy.</p></div>

<p class="caption smcap">Samuel Butler</p>
</div>

<p>Samuel Butler was born near Strensham, Worcestershire, in 1612,
the fifth child and second son of a farmer of that parish, whose
homestead was known to within the present century as "Butler's tenement."
The elder Butler was not well-to-do, but had enough to educate
his son at the Worcester Grammar School, and to send him to a
university. Whether or what time he was at Oxford or Cambridge
remains doubtful. A Samuel Butler went up from Westminster to
Christ Church, Oxford, 1623, too soon for the Worcester lad of<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2928" name="page2928">2928</a></span>
eleven years. Another doubtful tradition places him at Cambridge
in 1620. There is evidence that he was employed as a clerk by Mr.
Jeffreys, a justice of the peace at Earl's Croombe in Worcestershire,
and that while in this position he studied painting under Samuel
Cooper. A portrait of Oliver Cromwell attributed to his hand was
once in existence, and a number of paintings, said to have been by
him, hung on the walls at Earl's Croombe until they were used to
patch broken windows there in the last century. Butler went into
the service of Elizabeth, Countess of Kent, at Wrest in Bedfordshire,
where he had the use of a good library and the friendship of John
Selden, then steward of the Countess's estate. It was there and in
association with Selden that he began his literary work. Some time
afterward he held a servitor's position in the family of an officer of
Cromwell's army, Sir Samuel Luke, of Woodend, Bedfordshire. A
manuscript note in an old edition of 'Hudibras,' 1710, "from the
books of Phil. Lomax by gift of his father, G. Lomax," confirms the
tradition that this Cromwellian colonel was the original of Hudibras.
The elder Lomax is said to have been an intimate friend of Butler.
Another name on the list of candidates for this humorous honor&mdash;the
honor of contributing with Don Quixote to the increase of language&mdash;is
that of Sir Henry Rosewell of Ford Abbey, Devonshire.
But it is unnecessary to limit to an individual sample the satirist
and poet of the whole breadth of human nature. A presumption
that Butler was in France and Holland for a time arises from certain
references in his writings. It was about 1659, when the decline of
the Cromwells became assured, that Butler ventured, but anonymously,
into print with a tract warmly advocating the recall of the
King. At the Restoration, and probably in reward for this evidence
of loyalty, he was made secretary to the Earl of Carbury, President
of Wales, by whom he was appointed steward of Ludlow Castle.
About this time he married a gentlewoman of small fortune, and is
said to have lived comfortably upon her money until it was lost by
bad investments. The King having come to his own again, Butler
obtained permission in November 1662 to print the first part of 'Hudibras.'
The quaint title of this poem has attracted much curious
cavil. The name is used by Milton, Spenser, and Robert of Gloucester
for an early king of Britain, the grandfather of King Lear; and
by Ben Jonson&mdash;from whom Butler evidently adopted it&mdash;for a
swaggering fellow in the 'Magnetic Lady':&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Rut</i>&mdash;Where is your captain<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Rudhudibrass de Ironside?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="poem_note"><i>Act iii., Scene 3.</i></p>

<p>Charles II. was so delighted with the satire that he not only read
and reread it, but gave many copies to his intimates. The royal<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2929" name="page2929">2929</a></span>
generosity, lavish in promises, never exerted itself further than to
give Butler&mdash;or Boteler, as he is writ in the warrant&mdash;a monopoly
of printing his own poem.</p>

<p>The second part of 'Hudibras' appeared in 1664, and the third
and last in 1678.</p>

<p>The Duke of Buckingham was, we are told by Aubrey, well disposed
towards Butler, and Wycherley was a constant suitor in his
behalf; but the fickle favorite forgot his promises as easily as did
the King. Lord Clarendon, who had the witty poet's portrait painted
for his library, was no better at promise-keeping. It is natural that
such neglect should have provoked the sharp but just satires which
Butler wrote against the manners of Charles's dissolute court.</p>

<p>'Hudibras' was never finished; for Butler, who had been confined
by his infirmities to his room in Rose Court, Covent Garden, since
1676, died on September 25th, 1680. William Longueville, a devoted
friend but for whose kindness the poet might have starved, buried
the remains at his own expense in the churchyard of St. Paul's,
Covent Garden. In 1721 John Barber, Lord Mayor of London, set up
in the Poet's Corner of Westminster Abbey an inscription to Butler's
memory, which caused later satirists to suggest that this was giving
a stone to him who had asked for bread.</p>

<p>Butler was a plain man of middle stature, strong-set, high-colored,
with a head of sorrel hair. He possessed a severe and sound judgment,
but was "a good fellow," according to his friend Aubrey.</p>

<p>Many of Butler's writings were not published in his lifetime, during
which only the three parts of 'Hudibras' and some trifles
appeared. Longueville, who received his papers, left them, unpublished,
to his son Charles; from whom they came to John Clarke of
Cheshire, by whose permission the 'Genuine Remains' in two volumes
were published in 1759. The title of this book is due to the
fact that poor Butler, as is usual with his kind, became very popular
immediately after his death, and the ghouls of literature supplied the
book-shops with forgeries. Butler's manuscripts, many of which have
never been published, were placed in the British Museum in 1885.</p>

<h2><a name="LORD_BYRON" id="LORD_BYRON"></a>LORD BYRON</h2>

<p class="subtitle">(1788-1824)</p>

<p class="subtitle">BY CHARLES DUDLEY WARNER</p>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/cap_g.png" title="" alt="G" width="75" height="75" class="cap" />
<p class="cap_3"><span class="dcap">Goethe</span>, in one of his conversations with Henry Crabb Robinson
about Byron, said "There is no padding in his poetry"
("Es sind keine FlickwÃ¶rter im Gedichte"). This was in
1829, five years after Byron died. "This, and indeed every evening,
I believe, Lord Byron was the subject of his praise. He compared
the brilliancy and clearness of his style to a metal wire
drawn through a steel plate." He expressed regret that Byron
should not have lived to execute his vocation, which he said was "to
dramatize the Old Testament. What a subject under his hands
would the Tower of Babel have been!" Byron's views of nature he
declared were "equally profound and poetical." Power in all its
forms Goethe had respect for, and he was captivated by the indomitable
spirit of Manfred. He enjoyed the 'Vision of Judgment'
when it was read to him, exclaiming "Heavenly!" "Unsurpassable!"
"Byron has surpassed himself." He equally enjoyed the satire on
George IV. He did not praise Milton with the warmth with which
he eulogized Byron, of whom he said that "the like would never
come again; he was inimitable."</p></div>

<p>Goethe's was the Continental opinion, but it was heightened by
his conception of "realism"; he held that the poet must be matter-of-fact,
and that it was the truth and reality that made writing
popular: "It is by the laborious collection of facts that even a
poetical view of nature is to be corrected and authenticated."
Tennyson was equally careful for scientific accuracy in regard to all
the phenomena of nature. Byron had not scientific accuracy, but
with his objectivity Goethe sympathized more than with the reflection
and introspection of Wordsworth.</p>

<p>Byron was hailed on the Continent as a poet of power, and the
judgment of him was not influenced by his disregard of the society
conventions of England, nor by his personal eccentricities, nor
because he was not approved by the Tory party and the Tory
writers. Perhaps unconsciously&mdash;certainly not with the conviction of
Shelley&mdash;Byron was on the side of the new movement in Europe;
the spirit of Rousseau, the unrest of 'Wilhelm Meister,' the revolutionary
seething, with its tinge of morbidness and misanthropy, its
brilliant dreams of a new humanity, and its reckless destructive<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2936" name="page2936">2936</a></span>
theories. In France especially his influence was profound and lasting.
His wit and his lyric fire excused his morbidness and his sentimental
posing as a waif, unfriended in a cold and treacherous world of women
and men; and his genius made misanthropy and personal recklessness
a fashion. The world took his posing seriously and his grievances
to heart, sighed with him, copied his dress, tried to imitate his adventures,
many of them imaginary, and accepted him as a perturbed,
storm-tost spirit, representative of an age of agitation.</p>

<p>So he was, but not by consistent hypocritical premeditation; for
his pose was not so much of set purpose as in obedience to a false
education, an undisciplined temper, and a changing mind. He was
guided by the impulse of the moment. I think it a supportable
thesis that every age, every wide and popular movement, finds its
supreme expression in a Poet. Byron was the mouthpiece of a certain
phase of his time. He expressed it, and the expression remains and
is important as a record, like the French Revolution and the battle
of Waterloo. Whatever the judgment in history may be of the value
to civilization of this eighteenth-century movement extending into
the nineteenth, in politics, sociology, literature, with all its recklessness,
morbidness, hopefulness, Byron represented it. He was the
poet of Revolt. He sounded the note of intemperate, unconsidered
defiance in the 'English Bards and Scotch Reviewers.' This satire
was audacious; many of its judgments were unjust; but its wit and
poetic vigor announced a new force in English literature, and the
appearance of a man who was abundantly able to take care of himself
and secure respectful treatment. In moments afterward he
expressed regret for it, or for portions of it, and would have liked
to soften its personalities. He was always susceptible to kindness,
and easily won by the good opinion of even a declared enemy. He
and Moore became lifelong friends, and between him and Walter
Scott there sprang up a warm friendship, with sincere reciprocal
admiration of each other's works. Only on politics and religion did
they disagree, but Scott thought Byron's Liberalism not very deep:
"It appeared to me," he said, "that the pleasure it afforded him as a
vehicle of displaying his wit and satire against individuals in office
was at the bottom of this habit of thinking. At heart I would have
termed Byron a patrician on principle." Scott shared Goethe's opinion
of Byron's genius:&mdash;"He wrote from impulse, never for effect, and
therefore I have always reckoned Burns and Byron the most genuine
poetic geniuses of my time, and of half a century before me. We
have many men of high poetic talents, but none of that ever-gushing
and perennial fountain of natural waters." It has been a fashion of
late years to say that both Byron and Scott have gone by; I fancy it
is a case of "not lost, but gone before." Among the men satirized<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2937" name="page2937">2937</a></span>
in the 'Bards' was Wordsworth. Years after, Byron met him at a
dinner, and on his return told his wife that the "one feeling he had
for him from the beginning to the end of the visit was <i>reverence</i>."
Yet he never ceased to gird at him in his satires. The truth is,
that consistency was never to be expected in Byron. Besides, he
inherited none of the qualities needed for an orderly and noble life.
He came of a wild and turbulent race.</p>

<p>George Gordon, Lord Byron, the sixth of the name, was born in
London, January 22d, 1788, and died at Missolonghi, Greece, April
19th, 1824. His father, John Byron, a captain in the Guards, was a
heartless profligate with no redeeming traits of character. He eloped
with Amelia D'Arcy, wife of the Marquis of Carmarthen, and after
her divorce from her husband married her and treated her like a
brute. One daughter of this union was Augusta, Byron's half-sister,
who married Colonel Leigh, and who was the good angel of
the poet, and the friend of Lady Byron until there was a rupture of
their relations in 1830 on a matter of business. A year after the
death of his first wife, John Byron entrapped and married Catherine
Gordon of Gicht,&mdash;a Scotch heiress, very proud of her descent from
James I. of Scotland,&mdash;whose estate he speedily squandered. In less
than two years after the birth of George, John Byron ran away from
his wife and his creditors, and died in France.</p>

<p>Mrs. Byron was a wholly undisciplined and weak woman, proud
of her descent, wayward and hysterical. She ruined the child, whom
she alternately petted and abused. She interfered with his education
and fixed him in all his bad tendencies. He never learned
anything until he was sent away from her to Harrow. He was passionate,
sullen, defiant of authority, but very amenable to kindness;
and with a different mother his nobler qualities, generosity, sense of
justice, hatred of hypocrisy, and craving for friendship would have
been developed, and the story of his life would be very different
from what it is. There is no doubt that the regrettable parts of the
careers of both Byron and Shelley are due to lack of discipline and
loving-kindness in their early years. Byron's irritability and bad
temper were aggravated by a physical defect, which hindered him
from excelling in athletic sports of which he was fond, and embittered
all his life. Either at birth or by an accident one of his feet
was malformed or twisted so as to affect his gait, and the evil was
aggravated by surgical attempts to straighten the limb. His sensitiveness
was increased by unfeeling references to it. His mother
used to call him "a lame brat," and his pride received an incurable
wound in the heartless remark of Mary Chaworth, "Do you think I
could care for that lame boy?" Byron was two years her junior,
but his love for her was the purest passion of his life, and it has the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2938" name="page2938">2938</a></span>
sincerest expression in the famous 'Dream.' Byron's lameness, and
his morbid fear of growing obese, which led him all his life into
reckless experiments in diet, were permanent causes of his discontent
and eccentricity. In 1798, by the death of its incumbent, Byron
became the heir of Newstead Abbey and the sixth Lord Byron. He
had great pride in the possession of this crumbling and ruinous old
pile. After its partial repair he occupied it with his mother, and
from time to time in his stormy life; but in 1818 it was sold for
Â£90,000, which mostly went to pay debts and mortgages. Almost all
the influences about Byron's early youth were such as to foster his
worst traits, and lead to those eccentricities of conduct and temper
which came at times close to insanity. But there was one exception,
his nurse Mary Gray, to whom he owed his intimate knowledge of
the Bible, and for whom he always retained a sincere affection. It
is worth noting also, as an indication of his nature, that he always
had the love of his servants.</p>

<p>A satisfactory outline of Byron's life and work is found in Mr.
John Nichol's 'Byron' in the 'English Men of Letters' series. Owing
to his undisciplined home life, he was a backward boy in scholarship.
In 1805 he entered Trinity College, Cambridge, where he resided
irregularly for three years, reading much in a desultory manner, but
paying slight attention to the classics and mathematics; so that it
was a surprise that he was able to take his degree. But he had
keen powers of observation and a phenomenal memory. Notwithstanding
his infirmity he was distinguished in many athletic sports,
he was fond of animals and such uncomfortable pets as bears and
monkeys, and led generally an irregular life. The only fruit of this
period in literature was the 'Hours of Idleness,' which did not
promise much, and would be of little importance notwithstanding
many verses of great lyric skill, had it not been for the slashing
criticism on it, imputed to Lord Brougham, in the Edinburgh Review,
which provoked the 'English Bards and Scotch Reviewers.' This
witty outburst had instant success with the public.</p>

<p>In 1809 Byron came of age, and went abroad on a two-years' pilgrimage
to Spain, Malta, Greece, and Constantinople, giving free rein
to his humor for intrigue and adventure in the "lands of the sun,"
and gathering the material for many of his romances and poems.
He became at once the picturesque figure of his day,&mdash;a handsome,
willful poet, sated with life, with no regret for leaving his native
land; the conqueror of hearts and the sport of destiny. The world
was speedily full of romances of his recklessness, his intrigues, his
<i>diablerie</i>, and his munificence. These grew, upon his return in 1811
and the publication in 1812 of the first two cantos of 'Childe Harold.'
All London was at his feet. He had already made his first speech<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2939" name="page2939">2939</a></span>
in the House of Lords espousing the Liberal side. The second
speech was in favor of Catholic emancipation. The fresh and novel
poem, which Byron himself had not at first thought worth offering
a publisher, fell in with the humor and moral state of the town. It
was then that he made the oft-quoted remark, "I awoke one morning
and found myself famous." The poem gave new impetus to the
stories of his romantic life, and London seemed to idolize him as
much for his follies and his <i>liaisons</i> as for his genius. He plunged
into all the dissipation of the city. But this period from 1811 to 1815
was also one of extraordinary intellectual fertility. In rapid succession
he gave to the press poems and romances,&mdash;'The Giaour,' 'The
Bride of Abydos,' 'The Corsair,' 'Lara,' the 'Hebrew Melodies,' 'The
Siege of Corinth,' and 'Parisina.' Some of the 'Hebrew Melodies'
are unequaled in lyric fire. The romances are all taking narratives,
full of Oriental passion, vivid descriptions of scenery, and portraitures
of female loveliness and dark-browed heroes, often full of melody,
but melodramatic; and in substance do not bear analysis. But they
still impress with their flow of vitality, their directness and power of
versification, and their frequent beauty.</p>

<p>Sated with varied dissipation, worn out with the flighty adoration
of Lady Caroline Lamb, and urged by his friends to marry and
settle down, Byron married (January 2d, 1815) Anne Isabella, daughter
of Sir Ralph Milbanke. He liked but did not love her; and she was
no doubt fascinated by the reputation of the most famous man in
Europe, and perhaps indulged the philanthropic hope that she could
reform the literary Corsair. On the 10th of December was born
Augusta Ada, the daughter whom Byron celebrates in his verse and
to whom he was always tenderly attached. On the 15th of January,
five weeks after her daughter's birth, Lady Byron left home with the
child to pay a visit to her family, dispatching to her husband a playfully
tender letter. Shortly after, he was informed by her father and
by herself that she did not intend ever to return to him. It is useless
to enter into the controversy as to the cause of this separation.
In the light of the latest revelations, the better opinion seems to be
that it was a hopeless incongruity that might have been predicted
from the characters of the two. It seems that Lady Byron was not
quite so amiable as she was supposed to be, and in her later years she
was subject to hallucinations. Byron, it must be admitted, was an
impossible husband for any woman, most of all for any woman who
cared for the social conventions. This affair brought down upon
Byron a storm of public indignation which drove him from England.
The society which had petted him and excused his vagaries and violations
of all decency, now turned upon him with rage and made
the idol responsible for the foolishness of his worshipers. To the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2940" name="page2940">2940</a></span>
end of his life, neither society nor the critics ever forgave him, and
did not even do justice to his genius. His espousal of the popular
cause in Europe embittered the conservative element, and the freedom
of speculation in such masterly works as 'Cain' brought upon
him the anathemas of orthodox England. Henceforth in England
his poetry was judged by his liberal and unorthodox opinions. This
vituperation rose to its height when Byron dared to satirize George
III., and to expose mercilessly in 'Don Juan' the hypocrisy of English
life.</p>

<p>On the 25th of April, 1816, Byron left England, never to return.
And then opened the most brilliant period of his literary career.
Instead of being crushed by the situation, Byron's warlike spirit
responded to it with defiance, and his suffering and his anger invoked
the highest qualities of his extraordinary genius. His career
in Italy was as wild and dissipated as ever. Strange to say, the
best influence in his irregular life was the Countess Guiccioli, who
persuaded him at one time to lay aside the composition of 'Don
Juan,' and in whose society he was drawn into ardent sympathy
with the Italian liberals. For the cause of Italian unity he did
much when it was in its darkest period, and his name is properly
linked in this great achievement with those of Mazzini and Cavour.
It was in Switzerland, before Byron settled in Venice, that he met
Shelley, with whom he was thereafter to be on terms of closest intimacy.
Each had a mutual regard for the genius of the other, but
Shelley placed Byron far above himself. It was while sojourning
near the Shelleys on the Lake of Geneva that Byron formed a union
with Claire Clairmont, the daughter of Mrs. Clairmont, who became
William Godwin's second wife. The result of this intimacy was a
natural daughter, Allegra, for whose maintenance and education
Byron provided, and whose early death was severely felt by him.</p>

<p>Byron's life in Italy from 1816 to 1823 continued to be a romance
of exciting and dubious adventure. Many details of it are given in
Byron's letters,&mdash;his prose is always as vigorous as his poetry, and
as self-revealing,&mdash;and it was no doubt recorded in his famous
Diary, which was intrusted to his friend Tom Moore, and was burned
after Byron's death. Byron's own frankness about himself, his love
of mystification, his impulsiveness in writing anything that entered
his brain at the moment, and his habit of boasting about his wickedness,
which always went to the extent of making himself out worse
than he was, stands in the way of getting a clear narration of his
life and conduct. But he was always an interesting and commanding
and perplexing personality, and the writings about him by his intimates
are as various as the moods he indulged in. The bright light
of inquiry always shone upon him, for Byron was the most brilliant,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2941" name="page2941">2941</a></span>
the most famous, the most detested, the most worshiped, and the
most criticized and condemned man in Europe.</p>

<p>It was in this period that he produced the works that by their
innate vigor and power placed him in the front rank of English
poets. A complete list of them cannot be given in this brief notice.
The third and fourth cantos of 'Childe Harold' attained a height
that the first two cantos had not prepared the world to expect.
'Cain' was perhaps the culmination of his power. The lyrics and
occasional poems of this time add to his fame because they exhibit
his infinite variety. Critics point out the carelessness of his verse,&mdash;and
there is an air of haste in much of it; they deny his originality
and give the sources of his inspiration,&mdash;but he had Shakespeare's
faculty of transforming all things to his own will; and they
deny him the contribution of thought to the ideas of the world.
This criticism must stand against the fact of his almost unequaled
power to move the world and make it feel and think. The Continental
critics did not accuse him of want of substance. What did he
not do for Spain, for Italy, for Greece! No interpretation of their
splendid past, of their hope for the future, no musings over the
names of other civilizations, no sympathy with national pride, has
ever so satisfied the traveling and reading world in these lands, as
Byron's. The public is not so good a judge of what poetry should
be, as the trained critics; but it is a judge of power, of what is
stirring and entertaining: and so it comes to pass that Byron's work
is read when much poetry, more finished but wanting certain vital
qualities, is neglected. I believe it is a fact that Byron is more
quoted than any English poet except Pope since Shakespeare, and
that he is better known to the world at large than any except the
Master. But whether this is so or not, he is more read now at the
close of this century than he was in its third quarter.</p>

<p>'The Dream' and 'Darkness' are poems that will never lose their
value so long as men love and are capable of feeling terror. 'Manfred,'
'Mazeppa,' 'Heaven and Earth,' 'The Prisoner of Chillon,'
and the satire of the 'Vision of Judgment' maintain their prominence;
and it seems certain that many of the lyrics, like 'The Isles
of Greece' and the 'Maid of Athens,' will never pall upon any generation
of readers, and the lyrics will probably outlast the others in
general favor. Byron wrote many dramas, but they are not acting
plays. He lacked the dramatic instinct, and it is safe to say that
his plays, except in certain passages, add little to his great reputation.</p>

<p>In the opinion of many critics, Byron's genius was more fully
displayed in 'Don Juan' than in 'Childe Harold.' Byron was Don
Juan, mocking, satirical, witty, pathetic, dissolute, defiant of all<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2942" name="page2942">2942</a></span>
conventional opinion. The ease, the grace, the <i>diablerie</i> of the poem
are indescribable; its wantonness is not to be excused. But it is a
microcosm of life as the poet saw it, a record of the experience of
thirty years, full of gems, full of flaws, in many ways the most
wonderful performance of his time. The critics who were offended
by its satire of English hypocrisy had no difficulty in deciding that
it was not fit for English readers. I wonder what would be the
judgment of it if it were a recovered classic disassociated from the
personality of any writer.</p>

<p>Byron was an aristocrat, and sometimes exhibited a silly regard
for his rank; but he was a democrat in all the impulses of his
nature. His early feeling was that as a peer he condescended to
authorship, and for a time he would take no pay for what he wrote.
But later, when he needed money, he was keen at a bargain for his
poetry. He was extravagant in his living, generous to his friends
and to the popular causes he espoused, and cared nothing for money
except the pleasure of spending it. It was while he was living at
Ravenna that he became involved in the intrigues for Italian independence.
He threw himself, his fortune and his time, into it. The
time has come, he said, when a man must do something&mdash;writing
was only a pastime. He joined the secret society of the Carbonari;
he showed a statesmanlike comprehension of the situation; his
political papers bear the stamp of the qualities of vision and leadership.
When that dream faded under the reality of the armies
of despotism, his thoughts turned to Greece. Partly his restless
nature, partly love of adventure carried him there; but once in the
enterprise, he gave his soul to it with a boldness, a perseverance, a
good sense, a patriotic fervor that earn for him the title of a hero
in a good cause. His European name was a tower of strength to the
Greek patriots. He mastered the situation with a statesman's skill
and with the perception of a soldier; he endured all the hardships of
campaigning, and waited in patience to bring some order to the
wrangling factions. If his life had been spared, it is possible that
the Greeks then might have thrown off the Turkish yoke; but he
succumbed to a malarial fever, brought on by the exposure of a
frame weakened by a vegetable diet, and expired at Missolonghi in
his thirty-seventh year. He was adored by the Greeks, and his
death was a national calamity. This last appearance of Lord Byron
shows that he was capable of as great things in action as in the
realm of literature. It was the tragic end of the stormy career of a
genius whose life was as full of contradictions as his character.</p>

<p>It was not only in Greece that Byron's death was profoundly felt,
but in all Europe, which was under the spell of his genius. Mrs.
Anne Thackeray Ritchie, in her charming recollections of Tennyson,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2943" name="page2943">2943</a></span>
says:&mdash;"One day the news came to the village&mdash;the dire news which
spread across the land, filling men's hearts with consternation&mdash;that
Byron was dead. Alfred was then a boy about fifteen. 'Byron was
dead! I thought the whole world was at an end,' he once said,
speaking of those bygone days. 'I thought everything was over and
finished for every one&mdash;that nothing else mattered. I remember I
walked out alone and carved "Byron is dead" into the sandstone.'"</p>

<span class="i2">As I was darted from my foes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was the wild shout of savage laughter,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">They leave a weight upon our waking thoughts,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And look like heralds of eternity;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They pass like spirits of the past,&mdash;they speak<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like sibyls of the future; they have power&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tyranny of pleasure and of pain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They make us what we were not&mdash;what they will,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And make us with the vision that's gone by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dread of vanished shadows.&mdash;Are they so?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is not the past all shadow? What are they?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Creations of the mind?&mdash;The mind can make<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Substance, and people planets of its own<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I saw two beings in the hues of youth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Standing upon a hill, a gentle hill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Green and of mild declivity, the last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As 'twere the cape of a long ridge of such,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save that there was no sea to lave its base,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But a most living landscape, and the wave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of woods and corn-fields, and the abodes of men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scattered at intervals, and wreathing smoke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arising from such rustic roofs;&mdash;the hill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was crowned with a peculiar diadem<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of trees, in circular array, so fixed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not by the sport of nature, but of <ins class="correction" title="Punctuation unclear&mdash;assumed colon">man:</ins><br /></span>
<span class="i0">These two, a maiden and a youth, were there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gazing&mdash;the one on all that was beneath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fair as herself&mdash;but the boy gazed on her;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And both were young, and one was beautiful;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And both were young, yet not alike in youth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the sweet moon on the horizon's verge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The maid was on the eve of womanhood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The boy had fewer summers, but his heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had far outgrown his years, and to his eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There was but one beloved face on earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that was shining on him; he had looked<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon it till it could not pass away;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had no breath, no being, but in hers;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She was his voice; he did not speak to her,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But trembled on her words; she was his sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For his eye followed hers, and saw with hers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which colored all his objects;&mdash;he had ceased<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To live within himself; she was his life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ocean to the river of his thoughts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which terminated all: upon a tone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A touch of hers, his blood would ebb and flow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his cheek change tempestuously&mdash;his heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unknowing of its cause of agony.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But she in these fond feelings had no share:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her sighs were not for him; to her he was<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even as a brother&mdash;but no more: 'twas much,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page2991" name="page2991">2991</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">For brotherless she was, save in the name<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her infant friendship had bestowed on him;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Herself the solitary scion left<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a time-honored race.&mdash;It was a name<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which pleased him, and yet pleased him not&mdash;and why?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Time taught him a deep answer&mdash;when she loved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another; even <i>now</i> she loved another,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on the summit of that hill she stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looking afar if yet her lover's steed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kept pace with her expectancy, and flew.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Words which I could not guess of: then he leaned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His bowed head on his hands, and shook as 'twere<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a convulsion&mdash;then arose again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with his teeth and quivering hands did tear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What he had written, but he shed no tears.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he did calm himself, and fix his brow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into a kind of quiet: as he paused,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lady of his love re-entered there;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She was serene and smiling then, and yet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She knew she was by him beloved,&mdash;she knew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For quickly comes such knowledge, that his heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was darkened with her shadow, and she saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he was wretched; but she saw not all.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He rose, and with a cold and gentle grasp<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He took her hand; a moment o'er his face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A tablet of unutterable thoughts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was traced, and then it faded as it came;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He dropped the hand he held, and with slow steps<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Retired, but not as bidding her adieu,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For they did part with mutual smiles; he passed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From out the massy gate of that old hall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mounting on his steed he went his way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ne'er repassed that hoary threshold more.<br /></span>

<h2><a name="FERNAN_CABALLERO" id="FERNAN_CABALLERO"></a>FERNAN CABALLERO</h2>

<p class="subtitle">(CECILIA BÃ–HL DE FABER)</p>

<p class="subtitle">(1796-1877)</p>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/cap_e.png" title="" alt="E" width="75" height="75" class="cap" />
<p class="cap_1"><span class="dcap">England</span>, France, and Spain have each produced within this
century a woman of genius, taking rank among the very
first writers of their respective countries. Fernan Caballero,
without possessing the breadth of intellect or the scholarship of
George Eliot, or the artistic sense of George Sand, is yet worthy to
be named with these two great novelists for the place she holds in
Spanish literature. Interesting parallels might be drawn between
them, aside from the curious coincidence that each chose a masculine
pen-name to conceal her sex, and to gain the ear of a generation
suspicious of feminine achievements. Each portrayed both the life
of the gentleman and that of the rustic, and each is at her best in
her homelier portraitures.</p></div>

<p>Unlike her illustrious compeers, Fernan Caballero did not grow
up amid the scenes she drew. In the scanty records of her life it
does not appear whether, like George Sand, she had first to get rid
of a rebellious self before she could produce those objective masterpieces
of description, where the individuality of the writer disappears
in her realization of the lives and thoughts of a class alien to her
own. Her inner life cannot be reconstructed from her stories: her
outward life can be told in a few words. She was born December
25th, 1796, in Morges, Switzerland, the daughter of Juan Nicholas BÃ¶hl
de Faber, a German merchant in Cadiz, who had married a Spanish
lady of noble family. A cultivated man he was, greatly interested
in the past of Spain, and had published a collection of old Castilian
ballads. From him Cecilia derived her love of Spanish folk-lore.
Her earliest years were spent going from place to place with her
parents, now Spain, now Paris, now Germany. From six to sixteen
she was at school in Hamburg. Joining her family in Cadiz, she
was married at the age of seventeen. Left a widow within a short
time, she married after five years the wealthy Marquis de Arco-Hermaso.
His palace in Seville became a social centre, for his young
wife, beautiful, witty, and accomplished, was a born leader of society.
She now had to the full the opportunity of studying those types of
Spanish ladies and gentlemen whose gay, inconsequent chatter she has
so brilliantly reproduced in her novels dealing with high life. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="page3002" name="page3002">3002</a></span>
Marquis died in 1835, and after two years she again married, this
time the lawyer De Arrom. Losing his own money and hers, he
went as Spanish consul to Australia, where he died in 1863. She
remained behind, retired to the country, and turned to literature.
From 1857 to 1866 she lived in the Alcazar in Seville, as governess
to the royal children of Spain. She died April 7th, 1877, in Seville,&mdash;somewhat
solitary, for a new life of ideas flowing into Spain, and
opposing her intense conservatism, isolated her from companionship.</p>

<p>Fernan Caballero began to publish when past fifty, attained
instant success, and never again reached the high level of her first
book. 'La Gaviota' (The Sea-Gull) appeared in 1849 in the pages
of a Madrid daily paper, and at once made its author famous. 'The
Family of Alvoreda,' an earlier story, was published after her first
success. Washington Irving, who saw the manuscript of this,
encouraged her to go on. Her novels were fully translated, and she
soon had a European reputation. Her work may be divided into
three classes: novels of social life in Seville, such as 'Elia' and
'Clemencia'; novels of Andalusian peasant life, as 'The Family of
Alvoreda' ('La Gaviota' uniting both); and a number of short
stories pointing a moral or embodying a proverb. She published
besides, in 1859, the first collection of Spanish fairy tales.</p>

<p>Fernan Caballero created the modern Spanish novel. For two
hundred years after Cervantes there are few names of note in prose
fiction. French taste dominated Spanish literature, and poor imitations
of the French satisfied the reading public. A foreigner by
birth and a cosmopolitan by education, the clever new-comer cried
out against this foreign influence, and set herself to bring the
national characteristics to the front. She belonged to the old Spanish
school, with its Catholicism, its prejudices, its reverence for the
old, its hatred of new ideas and modern improvements. She painted
thus Old Spain with a master's brush. But she especially loved
Andalusia, that most poetic province of her country, with its deep-blue
luminous sky, its luxuriant vegetation, its light-hearted, witty
populace, and she wrote of them with rare insight and exquisite
tenderness. Tasked with having idealized them, she replied:&mdash;"Many
years of unremitting study, pursued <i>con amore</i>, justify me in assuring
those who find fault with my portrayal of popular life that they are
less acquainted with them than I am." And in another place she
says:&mdash;"It is amongst the people that we find the poetry of Spain
and of her chronicles. Their faith, their character, their sentiment,
all bear the seal of originality and of romance. Their language may
be compared to a garland of flowers. The Andalusian peasant is
elegant in his bearing, in his dress, in his language, and in his
<ins class="correction" title="Added period">ideas.</ins>"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page3003" name="page3003">3003</a></span>
Her stories lose immensely in the translation, for it is almost impossible
to reproduce in another tongue the racy native speech, with
its constant play on words, its wealth of epigrammatic proverbs, its
snatches of ballad or song interwoven into the common talk of the
day. The Andalusian peasant has an inexhaustible store of bits of
poetry, <i>coplas</i>, that fit into every occurrence of his daily life. Fernan
Caballero gathered up these flowers of speech as they fell from the
lips of the common man, and wove them into her tales. Besides their
pictures of Andalusian rural life, these stories reveal a wealth of
popular songs, ballads, legends, and fairy tales, invaluable alike to
the student of manners and of folk-lore. She has little constructive
skill, but much genius for detail. As a painter of manners and of
nature she is unrivaled. In a few bold strokes she brings a whole
village before our eyes. Nor is the brute creation forgotten. In her
sympathy for animals she shows her foreign extraction, the true
Spaniard having little compassion for his beasts. She inveighs against
the national sport, the bull-fight; against the cruel treatment of
domestic animals. Her work is always fresh and interesting, full of
humor and of pathos. A close observer and a realist, she never dwells
on the unlovely, is never unhealthy or sentimental. Her name is a
household word in Spain, where a foremost critic wrote of 'La
Gaviota':&mdash;"This is the dawn of a beautiful day, the first bloom of
a poetic crown that will encircle the head of a Spanish Walter
Scott."</p>

<p>Perhaps the best summary of her work is given in her own words,
where she says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"In composing this light work we did not intend to write a novel,
but strove to give an exact and true idea of Spain, of the manners
of its people, of their character, of their habits. We desired to
sketch the home life of the people in the higher and lower classes,
to depict their language, their faith, their traditions, their legends.
What we have sought above all is to paint after nature, and with
the most scrupulous exactitude, the objects and persons brought
forward. Therefore our readers will seek in vain amid our actors for
accomplished heroes or consummate villains, such as are found in
the romances of chivalry or in melodramas. Our ambition has been
to give as true an idea as possible of Spain and the Spaniards. We
have tried to dissipate those monstrous prejudices transmitted and
preserved like Egyptian mummies from generation to generation. It
seemed to us that the best means of attaining this end was to
replace with pictures traced by a Spanish pen those false sketches
sprung from the pens of strangers."</p></blockquote>

<h3><a name="THE_BULL-FIGHT" id="THE_BULL-FIGHT"></a>THE BULL-FIGHT</h3>

<p class="subtitle">From 'La Gaviota'</p>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="dcap">When</span> after dinner Stein and his wife arrived at the place
assigned for the bull-fight, they found it already filled
with people. A brief and sustained animation preceded
the fÃªte. This immense rendezvous, where were gathered
together all the population of the city and its environs; this
agitation, like to that of the blood which in the paroxysms of a
violent passion rushes to the heart; this feverish expectation, this
frantic excitement,&mdash;kept, however, within the limits of order;
these exclamations, petulant without insolence; this deep anxiety
which gives a quivering to pleasure: all this together formed a
species of moral magnetism; one must succumb to its force or
hasten to fly from it.</p>

<p>Stein, struck with vertigo, and his heart wrung, would have
chosen flight: his timidity kept him where he was. He saw
in all eyes which were turned on him the glowing of joy and
happiness; he dared not appear singular. Twelve thousand persons
were assembled in this place; the rich were thrown in the
shade, and the varied colors of the costumes of the Andalusian
people were reflected in the rays of the sun.</p>

<p>Soon the arena was cleared.</p>

<p>Then came forward the picadores, mounted on their unfortunate
horses, who with head lowered and sorrowful eyes seemed
to be&mdash;and were in reality&mdash;victims marching to the sacrifice.</p>

<p>Stein, at the appearance of these poor animals, felt himself
change to a painful compassion; a species of disgust which he
already experienced. The provinces of the peninsula which he had
traversed hitherto were devastated by the civil war, and he had
had no opportunity of seeing these fÃªtes, so grand, so national,
and so popular, where were united to the brilliant Moorish
strategy the ferocious intrepidity of the Gothic race. But he
had often heard these spectacles spoken of, and he knew that
the merit of a fight is generally estimated by the number of
horses that are slain. His pity was excited towards these poor
animals, which, after having rendered great services to their
masters,&mdash;after having conferred on them triumph, and perhaps
saved their lives,&mdash;had for their recompense, when age and the
excess of work had exhausted their strength, an atrocious death<span class="pagenum"><a id="page3005" name="page3005">3005</a></span>
which by a refinement of cruelty they were obliged themselves
to seek. Instinct made them seek this death; some resisted,
while others, more resigned or more feeble, went docilely before
them to abridge their agony. The sufferings of these unfortunate
animals touched the hardest heart; but the amateurs had
neither eyes, attention, nor interest, except for the bull. They
were under a real fascination, which communicated itself to
most of the strangers who came to Spain, and principally for
this barbarous amusement. Besides, it must be avowed&mdash;and
we avow it with grief&mdash;that compassion for animals is, in
Spain, particularly among the men, a sentiment more theoretical
than practical. Among the lower classes it does not exist at all.</p>

<p>The three picadores saluted the president of the fÃªte, preceded
by the banderilleros and the chulos, splendidly dressed, and carrying
the capas of bright and brilliant colors. The matadores
and their substitutes commanded all these combatants, and wore
the most luxurious costumes.</p>

<p>"Pepe Vera! here is Pepe Vera!" cried all the spectators.
"The scholar of MontÃ©s! Brave boy! What a jovial fellow!
how well he is made! what elegance and vivacity in all his
person! how firm his look! what a calm eye!"</p>

<p>"Do you know," said a young man seated near to Stein,
"what is the lesson MontÃ©s gives to his scholars? He pushes
them, their arms crossed, close to the bull, and says to them,
'Do not fear the bull&mdash;brave the bull!'"</p>

<p>Pepe Vera descended into the arena. His costume was of
cherry-colored satin, with shoulder-knots and silver embroidery
in profusion. From the little pockets of his vest stuck out the
points of orange-colored scarfs. A waistcoat of rich tissue of
silver and a pretty little cap of velvet completed his coquettish
and charming costume of majo.</p>

<p>After having saluted the authorities with much ease and
grace, he went like the other combatants to take his accustomed
place. The three picadores also went to their posts, at equal
distance from each other, near to the barrier. There was then
a profound, an imposing silence. One might have said that this
crowd, lately so noisy, had suddenly lost the faculty of breathing.</p>

<p>The alcalde gave the signal, the clarions sounded, and as if
the trumpet of the Last Judgment had been heard, all the spectators
arose with most perfect ensemble; and suddenly was seen
opened the large door of the toril, placed opposite to the box<span class="pagenum"><a id="page3006" name="page3006">3006</a></span>
occupied by the authorities. A bull whose hide was red precipitated
himself into the arena, and was assailed by a universal
explosion of cheers, of cries, of abuse, and of praise. At this
terrible noise the bull, affrighted, stopped short, raised his head;
his eyes were inflamed, and seemed to demand if all these provocations
were addressed to him; to him, the athletic and powerful,
who until now had been generous towards man, and who
had always shown favor towards him as to a feeble and weak
enemy. He surveyed the ground, turning his menacing head on
all sides&mdash;he still hesitated: the cheers, shrill and penetrating,
became more and more shrill and frequent. Then with a quickness
which neither his weight nor his bulk foretold, he sprang
towards the picador, who planted a lance in his withers. The
bull felt a sharp pain, and soon drew back. It was one of those
animals which in the language of bull-fighting are called "boyantes,"
that is to say, undecided and wavering; whence he did not
persist in his first attack, but assailed the second picador. This
one was not so well prepared as the first, and the thrust of his
lance was neither so correct nor so firm; he wounded the animal
without being able to arrest his advance. The horns of the
bull were buried in the body of the horse, who fell to the ground.
A cry of fright was raised on all sides, and the chulos surrounded
this horrible group; but the ferocious animal had seized his
prey, and would not allow himself to be distracted from his
vengeance. In this moment of terror, the cries of the multitude
were united in one immense clamor, which would have filled
the city with fright if it had not come from the place of the bull-fight.
The danger became more frightful as it was prolonged.</p>

<p>The bull tenaciously attacked the horse, who was overwhelmed
with his weight and with his convulsive movements, while the
unfortunate picador was crushed beneath these two enormous
masses. Then was seen to approach, light as a bird with
brilliant plumage, tranquil as a child who goes to gather flowers,
calm and smiling at the same time, a young man, covered with
silver embroidery and sparkling like a star. He approached in
the rear of the bull; and this young man of delicate frame, and
of appearance so distinguished, took in both hands the tail of the
terrible animal, and drew it towards him. The bull, surprised,
turned furiously and precipitated himself on his adversary, who
without a movement of his shoulder, and stepping backward,
avoided the first shock by a half-wheel to the right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page3007" name="page3007">3007</a></span>
The bull attacked him anew; the young man escaped a second
time by another half-wheel to the left, continuing to manage him
until he reached the barrier. There he disappeared from the
eyes of the astonished animal, and from the anxious gaze of the
public, who in the intoxication of their enthusiasm filled the air
with their frantic applause; for we are always ardently impressed
when we see man play with death, and brave it with so much
coolness.</p>

<p>"See now if he has not well followed the lesson of MontÃ©s!
See if Pepe Vera knows how to act with the bull!" said the
young man seated near to them, who was hoarse from crying
out.</p>

<p>The Duke at this moment fixed his attention on Marisalada.
Since the arrival of this young woman at the capital of Andalusia,
it was the first time that he had remarked any emotion on
this cold and disdainful countenance. Until now he had never
seen her animated. The rude organization of Marisalada was too
vulgar to receive the exquisite sentiment of admiration. There
was in her character too much indifference and pride to permit
her to be taken by surprise. She was astonished at nothing,
interested in nothing. To excite her, be it ever so little, to
soften some part of this hard metal, it was necessary to employ
fire and to use the hammer.</p>

<p>Stein was pale. "My lord Duke," he said, with an air full of
sweetness and of conviction, "is it possible that this diverts you?"</p>

<p>"No," replied the Duke; "it does not divert, it interests me."</p>

<p>During this brief dialogue they had raised up the horse. The
poor animal could not stand on his legs; his intestines protruded
and bespattered the ground. The picador was also raised up; he
was removed between the arms of the chulos. Furious against
the bull, and led on by a blind temerity, he would at all hazards
remount his horse and return to the attack, in spite of the dizziness
produced by his fall. It was impossible to dissuade him;
they saw him indeed replace the saddle upon the poor victim,
into the bruised flanks of which he dug his spurs.</p>

<p>"My lord Duke," said Stein, "I may perhaps appear to you
ridiculous, but I do not wish to remain at this spectacle. Maria,
shall we depart?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Maria, whose soul seemed to be concentrated in
her eyes. "Am I a little miss? and are you afraid that by
accident I may faint?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page3008" name="page3008">3008</a></span>
"In such case," said Stein, "I will come back and take you
when the course is finished." And he departed.</p>

<p>The bull had disposed of a sufficiently good number of horses.
The unfortunate courser which we have mentioned was taken
away&mdash;rather drawn than led by the bridle to the door, by
which he made his retreat. The others, which had not the
strength again to stand up, lay stretched out in the convulsions
of agony; sometimes they stretched out their heads as though
impelled by terror. At these last signs of life the bull returned
to the charge, wounding anew with plunges of his horns the
bruised members of his victims. Then, his forehead and horns
all bloody, he walked around the circus affecting an air of provocation
and defiance: at times he proudly raised his head towards
the amphitheatre, where the cries did not cease to be heard;
sometimes it was towards the brilliant chulos who passed before
him like meteors, planting their banderillos in his body. Often
from a cage, or from a netting hidden in the ornaments of a
banderillero, came out birds, which joyously took up their flight.
The first inventor of this strange and singular contrast could not
certainly have had the intention to symbolize innocence without
defense, rising above the horrors and ferocious passions here
below, in its happy flight towards heaven. That would be,
without doubt, one of those poetic ideas which are born spontaneously
in the hard and cruel heart of the Spanish plebeian,
as we see in Andalusia the mignonette plant really flourish between
stones and the mortar of a balcony.</p>

<p>At the signal given by the president of the course, the clarions
again sounded. There was a moment of truce in this bloody
wrestling, and it created a perfect silence.</p>

<p>Then Pepe Vera, holding in his left hand a sword and a red-hooded
cloak, advanced near to the box of the alcalde. Arrived
opposite, he stopped and saluted, to demand permission to slay
the bull.</p>

<p>Pepe Vera perceived the presence of the Duke, whose taste
for the bull-fight was well known; he had also remarked the
woman who was seated at his side, because this woman, to
whom the Duke frequently spoke, never took her eyes off the
matador.</p>

<p>He directed his steps towards the Duke, and taking off his
cap, said, "<i>Brindo</i> (I offer the honor of the bull) to you, my
lord, and to the royal person who is near you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page3009" name="page3009">3009</a></span>
At these words, casting his cap on the ground with an inimitable
abandon, he returned to his post.</p>

<p>The chulos regarded him attentively, all ready to execute his
orders. The matador chose the spot which suited him the best,
and indicated it to his quadrilla.</p>

<p>"Here!" he cried out to them.</p>

<p>The chulos ran towards the bull and excited him, and in
pursuing them met Pepe Vera, face to face, who had awaited his
approach with a firm step. It was the solemn moment of the
whole fight. A profound silence succeeded to the noisy tumult,
and to the warm excitement which until then had been exhibited
towards the matador.</p>

<p>The bull, on seeing this feeble enemy, who had laughed at
his fury, stopped as if he wished to reflect. He feared, without
doubt, that he would escape him a second time.</p>

<p>Whoever had entered into the circus at this moment would
sooner believe he was assisting in a solemn religious assembly,
than in a public amusement, so great was the silence.</p>

<p>The two adversaries regarded each other reciprocally.</p>

<p>Pepe Vera raised his left hand: the bull sprang on him.
Making only a light movement, the matador let him pass by his
side, returned and put himself on guard. When the animal
turned upon him the man directed his sword towards the extremity
of the shoulder, so that the bull, continuing his advance,
powerfully aided the steel to penetrate completely into his body.</p>

<p>It was done! He fell lifeless at the feet of his vanquisher.</p>

<p>To describe the general burst of cries and bravos which broke
forth from every part of this vast arena, would be a thing absolutely
impossible. Those who are accustomed to be present at
these spectacles alone can form an idea of it. At the same time
were heard the strains of the military bands.</p>

<p>Pepe Vera tranquilly traversed the arena in the midst of
these frantic testimonials of passionate admiration and of this
unanimous ovation, saluting with his sword right and left in
token of his acknowledgments. This triumph, which might have
excited the envy of a Roman emperor, in him did not excite the
least surprise&mdash;the least pride. He then went to salute the
ayuntamiento; then the Duke and the "royal" young lady.</p>

<p>The Duke then secretly handed to Maria a purse full of gold,
and she enveloped it in her handkerchief and cast it into the
arena.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page3010" name="page3010">3010</a></span>
Pepe Vera again renewed his thanks, and the glance of his
black eyes met those of the Gaviota. In describing the meeting
of these looks, a classic writer said that it wounded these two
hearts as profoundly as Pepe Vera wounded the bull.</p>

<p>We who have not the temerity to ally ourselves to this
severe and intolerant school, we simply say that these two
natures were made to understand each other&mdash;to sympathize.
They in fact did understand and sympathize.</p>

<p>It is true to say that Pepe had done admirably.</p>

<p>All that he had promised in a situation where he placed himself
between life and death had been executed with an address,
an ease, a dexterity, and a grace, which had not been baffled for
an instant.</p>

<p>For such a task it is necessary to have an energetic temperament
and a daring courage, joined to a certain degree of self-possession,
which alone can command twenty-four thousand eyes
which observe, and twenty-four thousand hands which applaud.</p>

<h3><a name="IN_THE_HOME_CIRCLE" id="IN_THE_HOME_CIRCLE"></a>IN THE HOME CIRCLE</h3>

<p class="subtitle">From 'La Gaviota'</p>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="dcap">A month</span> after the scenes we have described, Marisalada was
more sensible, and did not show the least desire to return
to her father's. Stein was completely re-established; his
good-natured character, his modest inclinations, his natural sympathies,
attached him every day more to the peaceful habits of
the simple and generous persons among whom he dwelt. He
felt relieved from his former discouragements, and his mind was
invigorated; he was cordially resigned to his present existence,
and to the men with whom he associated.</p>

<p>One afternoon, Stein, leaning against an angle of the convent
which faced the sea, admired the grand spectacle which the opening
of the winter season presented to his view. Above his head
floated a triple bed of sombre clouds, forced along by the impetuous
wind. Those lower down, black and heavy, seemed like
the cupola of an ancient cathedral in ruins, threatening at each
instant to sink down. When reduced to water they fell to the
ground. There was visible the second bed, less sombre and
lighter, defying the wind which chased them, and which separating
at intervals sought other clouds, more coquettish and<span class="pagenum"><a id="page3011" name="page3011">3011</a></span>
more vaporous, which they hurried into space, as if they feared
to soil their white robes by coming in contact with their companions.</p>

<p>"Are you a sponge, Don Frederico, so to like to receive all
the water which falls from heaven?" demanded JosÃ©, the shepherd
of Stein. "Let us enter; the roofs are made expressly for
such nights as these. My sheep would give much to shelter
themselves under some tiles."</p>

<p>Stein and the shepherd entered, and found the family assembled
around the hearth.</p>

<p>At the left of the chimney, Dolores, seated on a low chair,
held her infant; who, turning his back to his mother, supported
himself on the arm which encircled him like the balustrade of
a balcony; he moved about incessantly his little legs and his
small bare arms, laughing and uttering joyous cries addressed
to his brother Anis. This brother, gravely seated opposite the
fire on the edge of an empty earthen pan, remained stiff and
motionless, fearing that losing his equilibrium he would be
tossed into the said earthen pan&mdash;an accident which his mother
had predicted.</p>

<p>Maria was sewing at the right side of the chimney; her
granddaughters had for seats dry aloe leaves,&mdash;excellent seats,
light, solid, and sure. Nearly under the drapery of the chimney-piece
slept the hairy Palomo and a cat, the grave Morrongo,&mdash;tolerated
from necessity, but remaining by common consent at
a respectful distance from each other.</p>

<p>In the middle of this group there was a little low table, on
which burned a lamp of four jets; close to the table the Brother
Gabriel was seated, making baskets of the palm-tree; Momo was
engaged in repairing the harness of the good "Swallow" (the
ass); and Manuel, cutting up tobacco. On the fire was conspicuous
a stew-pan full of Malaga potatoes, white wine, honey, cinnamon,
and cloves. The humble family waited with impatience till
the perfumed stew should be sufficiently cooked.</p>

<p>"Come on! Come on!" cried Maria, when she saw her guest
and the shepherd enter. "What are you doing outside in
weather like this? 'Tis said a hurricane has come to destroy
the world. Don Frederico, here, here! come near the fire. Do
you know that the invalid has supped like a princess, and that
at present she sleeps like a queen! Her cure progresses well&mdash;is
it not so, Don Frederico?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page3012" name="page3012">3012</a></span>
"Her recovery surpasses my hopes."</p>

<p>"My soups!" added Maria with pride.</p>

<p>"And the ass's milk," said Brother Gabriel quietly.</p>

<p>"There is no doubt," replied Stein; "and she ought to continue
to take it."</p>

<p>"I oppose it not," said Maria, "because ass's milk is like the
turnip&mdash;if it does no good it does no harm."</p>

<p>"Ah! how pleasant it is here!" said Stein, caressing the children.
"If one could only live in the enjoyment of the present,
without thought of the future!"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, Don Frederico," joyfully cried Manuel, "'<i>Media
vida es la candela; pan y vino, la otra media.</i>'" (Half of life is
the candle; bread and wine are the other half.)</p>

<p>"And what necessity have you to dream of the future?"
asked Maria. "Will the morrow make us the more love to-day?
Let us occupy ourselves with to-day, so as not to render painful
the day to come."</p>

<p>"Man is a traveler," replied Stein; "he must follow his
route."</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied Maria, "man is a traveler; but if he
arrives in a quarter where he finds himself well off, he would
say, 'We are well here; put up our tents.'"</p>

<p>"If you wish us to lose our evening by talking of traveling,"
said Dolores, "we will believe that we have offended you, or
that you are not pleased here."</p>

<p>"Who speaks of traveling in the middle of December?" demanded
Manuel. "Goodness of heaven! Do you not see what
disasters there are every day on the sea?&mdash;hear the singing of the
wind! Will you embark in this weather, as you were embarked
in the war of Navarre? for as then, you would come out mortified
and ruined."</p>

<p>"Besides," added Maria, "the invalid is not yet entirely cured."</p>

<p>"Ah! there," said Dolores, besieged by the children, "if you
will not call off these creatures, the potatoes will not be cooked
until the Last Judgment."</p>

<p>The grandmother rolled the spinning-wheel to the corner, and
called the little infants to her.</p>

<p>"We will not go," they replied with one voice, "if you will
not tell us a story."</p>

<p>"Come, I will tell you one," said the good old woman. The
children approached. Anis took up his position on the empty<span class="pagenum"><a id="page3013" name="page3013">3013</a></span>
earthen pot, and the grandma commenced a story to amuse the
little children.</p>

<p>She had hardly finished the relation of this story when a
great noise was heard. The dog rose up, pointed his ears, and
put himself on the defensive. The cat bristled her hair and prepared
to fly. But the succeeding laugh very soon was frightful:
it was Anis, who fell asleep during the recital of his grandmother.
It happened that the prophecy of his mother was fulfilled as to
his falling into the earthen pan, where all his little person
disappeared except his legs, which stuck out like plants of a
new species. His mother, rendered impatient, seized with one
hand the collar of his vest, raised him out of this depth, and
despite his resistance held him suspended in the air for some
time&mdash;in the style represented in those card dancing-jacks, which
move arms and legs when you pull the thread which holds
them.</p>

<p>As his mother scolded him, and everybody laughed at him,
Anis, who had a brave spirit,&mdash;a thing natural in an infant,&mdash;burst
out into a groan which had nothing of timidity in it.</p>

<p>"Don't weep, Anis," said Paca, "and I will give you two
chestnuts that I have in my pocket."</p>

<p>"True?" demanded Anis.</p>

<p>Paca took out the two chestnuts, and gave them to him.
Instead of tears, they saw promptly shine with joy the two rows
of white teeth of the young boy.</p>

<p>"Brother Gabriel," said Maria, "did you not speak to me of
a pain in your eyes? Why do you work this evening?"</p>

<p>"I said truly," answered brother Gabriel; "but Don Frederico
gave me a remedy which cured me."</p>

<p>"Don Frederico must know many remedies, but he does not
know that one which never misses its effect," said the shepherd.</p>

<p>"If you know it, have the kindness to tell me," replied Stein.</p>

<p>"I am unable to tell you," replied the shepherd. "I know
that it exists, and that is all."</p>

<p>"Who knows it then?" demanded Stein.</p>

<p>"The swallows," said JosÃ©.</p>

<p>"The swallows?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. It is an herb which is called 'pito-real,' which
nobody sees or knows except the swallows: when their little ones
lose their sight the parents rub their eyes with the pito-real,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page3014" name="page3014">3014</a></span>
and cure them. This herb has also the virtue to cut iron&mdash;everything
it touches."</p>

<p>"What absurdities this JosÃ© swallows without chewing, like a
real shark!" interrupted Manuel, laughing. "Don Frederico, do
you comprehend what he said and believes as an article of faith?
He believes and says that snakes never die."</p>

<p>"No, they never die," replied the shepherd. "When they see
death coming they escape from their skin, and run away. With
age they become serpents; little by little they are covered with
scales and wings: they become dragons, and return to the desert.
But you, Manuel, you do not wish to believe anything. Do
you deny also that the lizard is the enemy of the woman, and
the friend of man? If you do not believe it, ask then of
Miguel."</p>

<p>"He knows it?"</p>

<p>"Without doubt, by experience."</p>

<p>"Whence did he learn it?" demanded Stein.</p>

<p>"He was sleeping in the field," replied JosÃ©. "A snake
glided near him. A lizard, which was in the furrow, saw it
coming, and presented himself to defend Miguel. The lizard,
which was of large form, fought with the snake. But Miguel
not awaking, the lizard pressed his tail against the nose of the
sleeper, and ran off as if his paws were on fire. The lizard is a
good little beast, who has good desires; he never sleeps in the
sun without descending the wall to kiss the earth."</p>

<p>When the conversation commenced on the subject of swallows,
Paca said to Anis, who was seated among his sisters, with his
legs crossed like a Grand Turk in miniature, "Anis, do you know
what the swallows say?"</p>

<p>"I? No. They have never spoken to me."</p>

<p>"Attend then: they say&mdash;" the little girl imitated the chirping
of swallows, and began to sing with volubility:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">"To eat and to drink!<br /></span>
<span class="i6">And to loan when you may;<br /></span>
<span class="i6">But 'tis madness to think<br /></span>
<span class="i6">This loan to repay.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flee, flee, pretty swallow, the season demands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fly swift on the wing, and reach other lands."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Is it for that they are sold?"</p>

<p>"For that," affirmed his sister.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page3015" name="page3015">3015</a></span>
During this time Dolores, carrying her infant in one hand,
with the other spread the table, served the potatoes, and distributed
to each one his part. The children ate from her plate, and
Stein remarked that she did not even touch the dish she had
prepared with so much care.</p>

<p>"You do not eat, Dolores?" he said to her.</p>

<p>"Do you not know the saying," she replied laughing, "'He
who has children at his side will never die of indigestion,' Don
Frederico? What they eat nourishes <ins class="correction" title="Remved extra quote, was me.'&quot;">me."</ins></p>

<p>Momo, who found himself beside this group, drew away his plate,
so that his brothers would not have the temptation to
ask him for its contents. His father, who remarked it, said to
him:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Don't be avaricious; it is a shameful vice: be not avaricious;
avarice is an abject vice. Know that one day an avaricious man
fell into the river. A peasant who saw it, ran to pull him out;
he stretched out his arm, and cried to him, 'Give me your
hand!' What had he to give? A miser&mdash;give! Before giving
him anything he allowed himself to be swept down by the current.
By chance he floated near to a fisherman: 'Take my hand!'
he said to him. As it was a question of taking, our man
was willing, and he escaped danger."</p>

<p>"It is not such wit you should relate to your son, Manuel,"
said Maria. "You ought to set before him, for example, the bad
rich man, who would give to the unfortunate neither a morsel of
bread nor a glass of water. 'God grant,' answered the beggar
to him, 'that all that you touch changes to this silver which you
so hold to.' The wish of the beggar was realized. All that the
miser had in his house was changed into metals as hard as his
heart. Tormented by hunger and thirst, he went into the country,
and having perceived a fountain of pure water, clear as
crystal, he approached with longing to taste it; but the moment
his lips touched it the water was turned to silver. He would
take an orange and the orange was changed to gold. He thus
died in a frenzy of rage and fury, cursing what he had desired."</p>

<p>Manuel, the strongest minded man in the assembly, bowed
down his head.</p>

<p>"Manuel," his mother said to him, "you imagine that we
ought not to believe but what is a fundamental article, and that
credulity is common only to the imbecile. You are mistaken:
men of good sense are credulous."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page3016" name="page3016">3016</a></span>
"But, my mother, between belief and doubt there is a
medium."</p>

<p>"And why," replied the good old woman, "laugh at faith,
which is the first of all virtues? How will it appear to you if
I say to you, 'I have given birth to you, I have educated you,
I have guided your earliest steps&mdash;I have fulfilled my obligations!'
Is the love of a mother nothing but an obligation? What
say you?"</p>

<p>"I would reply that you are not a good mother."</p>

<p>"Well, my son, apply that to what we were speaking of: he
who does not believe except from obligation, and only for that,
cannot cease to believe without being a renegade, a bad Christian;
as I would be a bad mother if I loved you only from
obligation."</p>

<p>"Brother Gabriel," interrupted Dolores, "why will you not
taste my potatoes?"</p>

<p>"It is a fast-day," replied Brother Gabriel.</p>

<p>"Nonsense! There is no longer convent, nor rules, nor fasts,"
cavalierly said Manuel, to induce the poor old man to participate
in the general repast. "Besides, you have accomplished sixty
years: put away these scruples, and you will not be damned for
having eaten our potatoes."</p>

<p>"Pardon me," replied Brother Gabriel, "but I ought to fast
as formerly, inasmuch as the Father Prior has not given me a
dispensation."</p>

<p>"Well done, Brother Gabriel!" added Maria; "Manuel shall
not be the demon tempter with his rebellious spirit, to incite
you to gormandize."</p>

<p>Upon this, the good old woman rose up and locked up in a
closet the plate which Dolores had served to the monk.</p>

<p>"I will keep it here for you until to-morrow morning, Brother
Gabriel."</p>

<p>Supper finished, the men, whose habit was always to keep
their hats on in the house, uncovered, and Maria said grace.</p>

<p>They were fresh, full of color and poetic
feeling&mdash;romantic with the romance
that abounds in the life they portrayed,
redolent of indigenous perfumes,&mdash;magnolia,
lemon, orange, and myrtle, mingled
with French exotics of the boudoir,&mdash;interpretive
in these qualities, through a fine
perception, of a social condition resulting
from the transplanting to a semi-tropical
soil of a conservative, wealthy, and aristocratic
French community. Herein lay
much of their most inviting charm; but
more than this, they were racy with twinkling
humor, tender with a melting pathos,
and intensely dramatic.</p>

<p>An intermixture of races with strong caste prejudices, and a time
of revolution and change, present eminently the condition and the
moment for the romance. And when added to this, he finds to his
hand an almost tropical setting, and so picturesque a confusion of
liquid tongues as exists in the old Franco-Spanish-Afro-Italian-American
city of New Orleans, there would seem to be nothing left to be
desired as "material." The artist who seized instinctively this opportunity
was born at New Orleans on October 12th, 1844, of colonial
Virginia stock on the one side, and New England on the other. His
early life was full of vicissitudes, and he was over thirty before he
discovered story-telling to be his true vocation. From that time he
has diligently followed it, having published three novels, 'The Grandissimes,'
'Dr. Sevier,' 'Bonaventure,' and 'John March, Southerner,'
besides another volume of short stories.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page3018" name="page3018">3018</a></span>
That having received his impressions in the period of transition
and ferment following the upheaval of 1861-1865, with the resulting
exaggerations and distortions of a normal social condition, he chose
to lay his scenes a half-century earlier, proclaims him still more the
artist; who would thus gain a freer play of fancy and a surer perspective,
and who, saturated with his subject, is not afraid to trust
his imagination to interpret it.</p>

<p>That he saw with open sympathetic eyes and a loving heart, he
who runs may read in any chance page that a casual opening of his
books will reveal. That the people whom he has so affectionately
depicted have not loved him in return, is perhaps only a corroboration
of his own words when he wrote, in his charming tale 'Belles
Demoiselles Plantation,' "The Creoles never forgive a public mention."
That they are tender of heart, sympathetic, and generous in
their own social and domestic relations, Mr. Cable's readers cannot
fail to know. But the caste line has ever been a dangerous boundary&mdash;a
live wire charged with a deadly if invisible fluid&mdash;and he is a
brave man who dares lay his hand upon it.</p>

<p>More than this, the old-time Creole was an aristocrat who chose
to live behind a battened door, as does his descendant to-day. His
privacy, so long undisturbed, has come to be his prerogative. Witness
this spirit in the protest of the inimitable Jean-ah Poquelin&mdash;the
hero giving his name to one of the most dramatic stories ever
penned&mdash;when he presents himself before the American governor of
Louisiana to declare that he will not have his privacy invaded by a
proposed street to pass his door:&mdash;"I want you tell Monsieur le
President, <i>strit&mdash;can't&mdash;pass&mdash;at&mdash;me&mdash;'ouse</i>." The Creoles of Mr.
Cable's generation are as jealous of their retirement as was the brave
old man Poquelin; and to have it invaded by a young American who
not only threw their pictures upon his canvas, but standing behind
it, reproduced their eccentricities of speech for applauding Northern
audiences, was a crime unforgivable in their moral code.</p>

<p>Added to this, Mr. Cable stands accused of giving the impression
that the Louisiana Creole is a person of African taint; but are there
not many refutations of this charge in the internal evidence of his
work? As for instance where in 'The Grandissimes' he writes, "His
whole appearance was a dazzling contradiction of the notion that
a Creole is a person of mixed blood"; and again when he alludes
to "the slave dialect," is the implication not unequivocal that this
differed from the speech of the drawing-room? It is true that he
found many of his studies in the Quadroon population, who spoke a
patois that was partly French; but such was the "slave dialect" of
the man of color who came into his English through a French strain,
or perhaps only through a generation of close French environment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page3019" name="page3019">3019</a></span>
A civilization that is as protective in its conservatism as are the
ten-foot walls of brick with which its people surround their luxurious
dwellings may be counted on to resent portrayal at short range,
even though it were unequivocally eulogistic. That Mr. Cable is a
most conscientious artist, and that he has been absolutely true to
the letter as he saw it, there can be no question; but whether his
technical excellences are always broadly representative or not is not
so certain. That the writer who has so amply proven his own joy
in the wealth of his material, should have been beguiled by its picturesqueness
into a partisanship for the class making a special appeal,
is not surprising. But truth in art is largely a matter of selection;
and if Mr. Cable has sinned in the gleaning, it was undoubtedly
because of visual limitation, rather than a conscious discrimination.</p>

<p>In 'The Grandissimes,' his most ambitious work, we have an
important contribution to representative literature. In the pleasant
guise of his fascinating fiction he has essayed the history of a civilization,
and in many respects the result is a great book. That such
a work should attain its highest merit in impartial truth when taken
as a whole, goes without saying.</p>

<p>The dramatic story of Bras CoupÃ© is true as belonging to the
time and the situation. So is that of Palmyrea the Octoroon, or of
HonorÃ© Grandissime's "f. m. c." the half-brother, or of the pitiful
voudou woman Clemence, the wretched old <i>marchande de calas</i>. Had
he produced nothing more than his first small volume of seven tales,
he would have made for himself an honored place in literature.</p>

<p>As a collection, these stories are unrivaled for pictorial power and
dramatic form, and are so nearly of equal merit that any one would
be as representative in the popular mind as the one which is given
here.</p>

<p class="subtitle">From 'Old Creole Days': copyrighted 1879, 1881, 1883, by Charles Scribner's
Sons</p>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="dcap">To Jules St. Ange</span>&mdash;elegant little heathen&mdash;there yet remained
at manhood a remembrance of having been to school, and
of having been taught by a stony-headed Capuchin that the
world is round&mdash;for example, like a cheese. This round world
is a cheese to be eaten through, and Jules had nibbled quite
into his cheese-world already at twenty-two.</p>

<p>He realized this, as he idled about one Sunday morning where
the intersection of Royal and Conti Streets some seventy years
ago formed a central corner of New Orleans. Yes, yes, the
trouble was he had been wasteful and honest. He discussed the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page3020" name="page3020">3020</a></span>
matter with that faithful friend and confidant, Baptiste, his yellow
body-servant. They concluded that, papa's patience and
<i>tante's</i> pin-money having been gnawed away quite to the rind,
there were left open only these few easily enumerated resorts:&mdash;to
go to work&mdash;they shuddered; to join Major Innerarity's filibustering
expedition; or else&mdash;why not?&mdash;to try some games of
confidence. At twenty-two one must begin to be something.
Nothing else tempted; could that avail? One could but try. It
is noble to try; and besides, they were hungry. If one could
"make the friendship" of some person from the country, for
instance, with money,&mdash;not expert at cards or dice, but as one
would say, willing to learn,&mdash;one might find cause to say some
"Hail Marys."</p>

<p>The sun broke through a clearing sky, and Baptiste pronounced
it good for luck. There had been a hurricane in the
night. The weed-grown tile-roofs were still dripping, and from
lofty brick and low adobe walls a rising steam responded to the
summer sunlight. Up-street, and across the Rue du Canal, one
could get glimpses of the gardens in Faubourg Ste.-Marie standing
in silent wretchedness, so many tearful Lucretias, tattered
victims of the storm. Short remnants of the wind now and then
came down the narrow street in erratic puffs, heavily laden with
odors of broken boughs and torn flowers, skimmed the little
pools of rain-water in the deep ruts of the unpaved street, and
suddenly went away to nothing, like a juggler's butterflies or a
young man's money.</p>

<p>It was very picturesque, the Rue Royale. The rich and poor
met together. The locksmith's swinging key creaked next door
to the bank; across the way, crouching mendicant-like in the
shadow of a great importing house, was the mud laboratory of
the mender of broken combs. Light balconies overhung the
rows of showy shops and stores open for trade this Sunday
morning, and pretty Latin faces of the higher class glanced over
their savagely pronged railings upon the passers below. At some
windows hung lace curtains, flannel duds at some, and at others
only the scraping and sighing one-hinged shutter groaning toward
Paris after its neglectful master.</p>

<p>M. St.-Ange stood looking up and down the street for nearly
an hour. But few ladies, only the inveterate mass-goers, were
out. About the entrance of the frequent <i>cafÃ©'s</i> the masculine
gentility stood leaning on canes, with which now one and now<span class="pagenum"><a id="page3021" name="page3021">3021</a></span>
another beckoned to Jules, some even adding pantomimic hints of
the social cup.</p>

<p>M. St.-Ange remarked to his servant without turning his head
that somehow he felt sure he should soon return those <i>bons</i> that
the mulatto had lent him.</p>

<p>"What will you do with them?"</p>

<p>"Me!" said Baptiste, quickly; "I will go and see the bull-fight
in the Place Congo."</p>

<p>"There is to be a bull-fight? But where is M. Cayetano?"</p>

<p>"Ah, got all his affairs wet in the tornado. Instead of his circus,
they are to have a bull-fight&mdash;not an ordinary bull-fight with
sick horses, but a buffalo-and-tiger fight. I would not miss it&mdash;"</p>

<p>Two or three persons ran to the opposite corner, and commenced
striking at something with their canes. Others followed.
Can M. St.-Ange and servant, who hasten forward&mdash;can the
Creoles, Cubans, Spaniards, San Domingo refugees, and other
loungers&mdash;can they hope it is a fight? They hurry forward. Is
a man in a fit? The crowd pours in from the side-streets. Have
they killed a so-long snake? Bareheaded shopmen leave their
wives, who stand upon chairs. The crowd huddles and packs.
Those on the outside make little leaps into the air, trying to be
tall.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?"</p>

<p>"Have they caught a real live rat?"</p>

<p>"Who is hurt?" asks some one in English.</p>

<p>"<i>Personne</i>," replies a shopkeeper; "a man's hat blow' in the
gutter; but he has it now. Jules pick' it. See, that is the man,
head and shoulders on top the res'."</p>

<p>"He in the homespun?" asks a second shopkeeper. "Humph!
an <i>AmÃ©ricain</i>&mdash;a West-Floridian; bah!"</p>

<p>"But wait; 'st! he is speaking; listen!"</p>

<p>"To who is he speak&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Sh-sh-sh! to Jules."</p>

<p>"Jules who?"</p>

<p>"Silence, you! To Jules St.-Ange, what howe me a bill since
long time. Sh-sh-sh!"</p>

<p>Then the voice was heard.</p>

<p>Its owner was a man of giant stature, with a slight stoop in
his shoulders, as if he was making a constant good-natured attempt
to accommodate himself to ordinary doors and ceilings.
His bones were those of an ox. His face was marked more by<span class="pagenum"><a id="page3022" name="page3022">3022</a></span>
weather than age, and his narrow brow was bald and smooth.
He had instantaneously formed an opinion of Jules St.-Ange, and
the multitude of words, most of them lingual curiosities, with
which he was rasping the wide-open ears of his listeners, signified,
in short, that as sure as his name was Parson Jones, the little
Creole was a "plum gentleman."</p>

<p>M. St.-Ange bowed and smiled, and was about to call attention,
by both gesture and speech, to a singular object on top of
the still uncovered head, when the nervous motion of the <i>AmÃ©ricain</i>
anticipated him, as, throwing up an immense hand, he drew
down a large roll of bank-notes. The crowd laughed, the West-Floridian
joining, and began to disperse.</p>

<p>"Why, that money belongs to Smyrny Church," said the
giant.</p>

<p>"You are very dengerous to make your money expose like
that, Misty Posson Jone'," said St.-Ange, counting it with his
eyes.</p>

<p>The countryman gave a start and smile of surprise.</p>

<p>"How d'dyou know my name was Jones?" he asked; but,
without pausing for the Creole's answer, furnished in his reckless
way some further specimens of West-Floridian English; and
the conciseness with which he presented full intelligence of his
home, family, calling, lodging-house, and present and future
plans, might have passed for consummate art, had it not been
the most run-wild nature. "And I've done been to Mobile, you
know, on busi<i>ness</i> for Bethesdy Church. It's the on'yest time I
ever been from home; now you wouldn't of believed that, would
you? But I admire to have saw you, that's so. You've got to
come and eat with me. Me and my boy ain't been fed yit.
What might one call yo' name? Jools? Come on, Jools. Come
on, Colossus. That's my niggah&mdash;his name's Colossus of Rhodes.
Is that yo' yallah boy, Jools? Fetch him along, Colossus. It
seems like a special provi<i>dence</i>.&mdash;Jools, do you believe in a
special provi<i>dence</i>?"</p>

<p>Jules said he did.</p>

<p>The new-made friends moved briskly off, followed by Baptiste
and a short square old negro, very black and grotesque, who
had introduced himself to the mulatto with many glittering and
cavernous smiles as "d'body-servant of d'Rev'n' Mr. Jones."</p>

<p>Both pairs enlivened their walk with conversation. Parson
Jones descanted upon the doctrine he had mentioned, as illus<span class="pagenum"><a id="page3023" name="page3023">3023</a></span>trated
in the perplexities of cotton-growing, and concluded that
there would always be "a special provi<i>dence</i> again' cotton untell
folks quits a-pressin' of it and haulin' of it on Sundays!"</p>

<p>"<i>Je dis</i>," said St.-Ange, in response, "I thing you is juz
right. I believe, me, strong-strong in the improvidence, yes.
You know my papa he hown a sugah-plantation, you know.
'Jules, me son,' he say one time to me, 'I goin' to make one
baril sugah to fedge the moze high price in New Orleans.'
Well, he take his bez baril sugah&mdash;I nevah see a so careful
man like me papa always to make a so beautiful sugah <i>et sirop</i>.
'Jules, go at Father Pierre an' ged this lill pitcher fill with holy-water,
an' tell him sen' his tin bucket, and I will make it fill
with <i>quitte</i>.' I ged the holy-water; my papa sprinkle it over the
baril, an' make one cross on the 'ead of the baril."</p>

<p>"Why, Jools," said Parson Jones, "that didn't do no good."</p>

<p>"Din do no good! Id broughd the so great value! You can
strike me dead if thad baril sugah din fedge the more high cost
than any other in the city. <i>Parceque</i>, the man what buy that
baril sugah he make a mistake of one hundred pound"&mdash;falling
back&mdash;"<i>mais</i> certainlee!"</p>

<p>"And you think that was growin' out of the holy-water?"
asked the parson.</p>

<p>"<i>Mais</i>, what could make it else? Id could not be the <i>quitte</i>,
because my papa keep the bucket, an' forget to sen' the <i>quitte</i> to
Father Pierre."</p>

<p>Parson Jones was disappointed.</p>

<p>"Well, now, Jools, you know, I don't think that was right.
I reckon you must be a plum Catholic."</p>

<p>M. St.-Ange shrugged. He would not deny his faith.</p>

<p>"I am a <i>Catholique</i>, <i>mais</i>"&mdash;brightening as he hoped to
recommend himself anew&mdash;"not a good one."</p>

<p>"Well, you know," said Jones&mdash;"where's Colossus? Oh! all
right. Colossus strayed off a minute in Mobile, and I plum lost
him for two days. Here's the place; come in. Colossus and
this boy can go to the kitchen.&mdash;Now, Colossus, what <i>air</i> you
a-beckonin' at me faw?"</p>

<p>He let his servant draw him aside and address him in a
whisper.</p>

<p>"Oh, go 'way!" said the parson with a jerk. "Who's goin'
to throw me? What? Speak louder. Why, Colossus, you
shayn't talk so, saw. 'Pon my soul, you're the mightiest fool<span class="pagenum"><a id="page3024" name="page3024">3024</a></span>
I ever taken up with. Jest you go down that alley-way with
this yalla boy, and don't show yo' face untell yo' called!"</p>

<p>The negro begged; the master wrathily insisted.</p>

<p>"Colossus, will you do ez I tell you, or shell I hev' to strike
you, saw?"</p>

<p>"Oh Mahs Jimmy, I&mdash;I's gwine; but&mdash;" he ventured nearer&mdash;"don't
on no account drink nothin', Mahs Jimmy."</p>

<p>Such was the negro's earnestness that he put one foot in the
gutter, and fell heavily against his master. The parson threw
him off angrily.</p>

<p>"Thar, now! Why, Colossus, you must of been dosted with
sumthin'; yo' plum crazy.&mdash;Humph, come on, Jools, let's eat!
Humph! to tell me that, when I never taken a drop, exceptin'
for chills, in my life&mdash;which he knows so as well as me!"</p>

<p>The two masters began to ascend a stair.</p>

<p>"<i>Mais</i>, he is a sassy; I would sell him, me," said the young
Creole.</p>

<p>"No, I wouldn't do that," replied the parson; "though there
is people in Bethesdy who says he is a rascal. He's a powerful
smart fool. Why, that boy's got money, Jools; more money
than religion, I reckon. I'm shore he fallen into mighty bad
company&mdash;" they passed beyond earshot.</p>

<p>Baptiste and Colossus, instead of going to the tavern kitchen,
passed to the next door and entered the dark rear corner of a
low grocery, where, the law notwithstanding, liquor was covertly
sold to slaves. There, in the quiet company of Baptiste and the
grocer, the colloquial powers of Colossus, which were simply
prodigious, began very soon to show themselves.</p>

<p>"For whilst," said he, "Mahs Jimmy has eddication, you
know&mdash;whilst he has eddication, I has 'scretion. He has eddication
and I has 'scretion, an' so we gits along."</p>

<p>He drew a black bottle down the counter, and, laying half his
length upon the damp board, continued:&mdash;</p>

<p>"As a p'inciple I discredits de imbimin' of awjus liquors. De
imbimin' of awjus liquors, de wiolution of de Sabbaf, de playin'
of de fiddle, and de usin' of bywords, dey is de fo' sins of de
conscience, an' if any man sin de fo' sins of de conscience, de
debble done sharp his fork fo' dat man.&mdash;Ain't dat so, boss?"</p>

<p>The grocer was sure it was so.</p>

<p>"Neberdeless, mind you&mdash;" here the orator brimmed his glass
from the bottle and swallowed the contents with a dry eye<span class="pagenum"><a id="page3025" name="page3025">3025</a></span>&mdash;"mind
you, a roytious man, sech as ministers of de gospel and
dere body-sarvants, can take a <i>leetle</i> for de weak stomach."</p>

<p>But the fascinations of Colossus's eloquence must not mislead
us; this is the story of a true Christian; to wit, Parson Jones.</p>

<p>The parson and his new friend ate. But the coffee M. St.-Ange
declared he could not touch: it was too wretchedly bad.
At the French Market, near by, there was some noble coffee.
This, however, would have to be bought, and Parson Jones had
scruples.</p>

<p>"You see, Jools, every man has his conscience to guide him,
which it does so in&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" cried St.-Ange, "conscien'; thad is the bez, Posson
Jone'. Certainlee! I am a <i>Catholique</i>, you is a <i>schismatique</i>:
you thing it is wrong to dring some coffee&mdash;well, then, it <i>is</i>
wrong; you thing it is wrong to make the sugah to ged the so
large price&mdash;well, then, it <i>is</i> wrong; I thing it is right&mdash;well,
then, it <i>is</i> right: it is all 'abit; <i>c'est tout</i>. What a man thing is
right, <i>is right</i>; 'tis all 'abit. A man muz nod go again' his conscien'.
My faith! do you thing I would go again' my conscien'?
<i>Mais allons</i>, led us go and ged some <ins class="correction" title="Added period">coffee.</ins>"</p>

<p>"Jools."</p>

<p>"W'at?"</p>

<p>"Jools, it ain't the drinkin' of coffee, but the buyin' of it on a
Sabbath. You must really excuse me, Jools, it's again' conscience,
you know."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said St.-Ange, "<i>c'est</i> very true. For you it would be
a sin, <i>mais</i> for me it is only 'abit. Rilligion is a very strange;
I know a man one time, he thing it was wrong to go to cock-fight
Sunday evening. I thing it is all 'abit. <i>Mais</i>, come, Posson
Jone'; I have got one friend, Miguel; led us go at his house
and ged some coffee. Come; Miguel have no familie; only him
and Joe&mdash;always like to see friend; <i>allons</i>, led us come yonder."</p>

<p>"Why, Jools, my dear friend, you know," said the shamefaced
parson, "I never visit on Sundays."</p>

<p>"Never w'at?" asked the astounded Creole.</p>

<p>"No," said Jones, smiling awkwardly.</p>

<p>"Never visite?"</p>

<p>"Exceptin' sometimes amongst church-members," said Parson
Jones.</p>

<p>"<i>Mais</i>," said the seductive St.-Ange, "Miguel and Joe is
church-member'&mdash;certainlee! They love to talk about rilligion.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page3026" name="page3026">3026</a></span>
Come at Miguel and talk about some rilligion. I am nearly
expire for me coffee."</p>

<p>Parson Jones took his hat from beneath his chair and rose up.</p>

<p>"Jools," said the weak giant, "I ought to be in church right
now."</p>

<p>"<i>Mais</i>, the church is right yonder at Miguel', yes. Ah!"
continued St.-Ange, as they descended the stairs, "I thing every
man muz have the rilligion he like the bez&mdash;me, I like the
<i>Catholique</i> rilligion the bez&mdash;for me it <i>is</i> the bez. Every man
will sure go to heaven if he like his rilligion the bez."</p>

<p>"Jools," said the West-Floridian, laying his great hand tenderly
upon the Creole's shoulder, as they stepped out upon the <i>banquette</i>,
"do you think you have any shore hopes of heaven?"</p>

<p>"Yass!" replied St.-Ange; "I am sure-sure. I thing everybody
will go to heaven. I thing you will go, <i>et</i> I thing Miguel
will go, <i>et</i> Joe&mdash;everybody, I thing&mdash;<i>mais</i>, hof course, not if they
not have been christen'. Even I thing some niggers will go."</p>

<p>"Jools," said the parson, stopping in his walk&mdash;"Jools, I
<i>don't</i> want to lose my niggah."</p>

<p>"You will not loose him. With Baptiste he <i>cannot</i> ged loose."</p>

<p>But Colossus's master was not reassured. "Now," said he,
still tarrying, "this is jest the way; had I of gone to church&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Posson Jone'&mdash;" said Jules.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I tell you. We goin' to church!"</p>

<p>"Will you?" asked Jones, joyously.</p>

<p>"<i>Allons</i>, come along," said Jules, taking his elbow.</p>

<p>They walked down the Rue Chartres, passed several corners,
and by-and-by turned into a cross-street. The parson stopped
an instant as they were turning, and looked back up the street.</p>

<p>"W'at you lookin'?" asked his companion.</p>

<p>"I thought I saw Colossus," answered the parson, with an
anxious face; "I reckon 'twa'nt him, though." And they went on.</p>

<p>The street they now entered was a very quiet one. The eye
of any chance passer would have been at once drawn to a broad,
heavy, white brick edifice on the lower side of the way, with a
flag-pole standing out like a bowsprit from one of its great
windows, and a pair of lamps hanging before a large closed
entrance. It was a theatre, honeycombed with gambling-dens.
At this morning hour all was still, and the only sign of life was
a knot of little barefoot girls gathered within its narrow shade,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page3027" name="page3027">3027</a></span>
and each carrying an infant relative. Into this place the parson
and M. St.-Ange entered, the little nurses jumping up from the
sills to let them pass in.</p>

<p>A half-hour may have passed. At the end of that time the
whole juvenile company were laying alternate eyes and ears to
the chinks, to gather what they could of an interesting quarrel
going on within.</p>

<p>"I did not, saw! I given you no cause of offense, saw! It's
not so, saw! Mister Jools simply mistaken the house,&mdash;thinkin'
it was a Sabbath-school! No such thing, saw; I <i>ain't</i> bound to
bet! Yes, I kin git out! Yes, without bettin'! I hev a right to
my <i>o</i>pinion; I reckon I'm <i>a white man</i>, saw! No, saw! I on'y
said I didn't think you could get the game on them cards. 'Sno
such thing, saw! I do <i>not</i> know how to play! I wouldn't hev a
rascal's money ef I should win it! Shoot ef you dare! You can
kill me, but you cayn't scare me! No, I shayn't bet! I'll die
first! Yes, saw; Mr. Jools can bet for me if he admires to; I
ain't his mostah."</p>

<p>Here the speaker seemed to direct his words to St.-Ange.</p>

<p>"Saw, I don't understand you, saw. I never said I'd loan
you money to bet for me. I didn't suspicion this from you, saw.
No, I won't take any more lemonade; it's the most notorious
stuff I ever drank, saw!"</p>

<p>M. St.-Ange's replies were in <i>falsetto</i> and not without effect;
for presently the parson's indignation and anger began to melt.
"Don't ask me, Jools, I can't help you. It's no use; it's a matter
of conscience with me, Jools."</p>

<p>"<i>Mais oui!</i> 'tis a matt' of conscien' wid me, the same."</p>

<p>"But, Jools, the money's none o' mine, nohow; it belongs to
Smyrny, you know."</p>

<p>"If I could make jus' <i>one</i> bet," said the persuasive St.-Ange,
"I would leave this place, fas'-fas', yes. If I had thing&mdash;<i>mais</i> I
did not soupspicion this from you, Posson Jone'&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't, Jools, don't!"</p>

<p>"No, Posson Jone'!"</p>

<p>"You're bound to win?" said the parson, wavering.</p>

<p>"<i>Mais certainement!</i> But it is not to win that I want; 'tis
me conscien'&mdash;me honor!"</p>

<p>"Well, Jools, I hope I'm not a-doin' no wrong. I'll loan you
some of this money if you say you'll come right out 'thout takin'
your winnin's."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page3028" name="page3028">3028</a></span>
All was still. The peeping children could see the parson as
he lifted his hand to his breast-pocket. There it paused a
moment in bewilderment, then plunged to the bottom. It came
back empty, and fell lifelessly at his side. His head dropped
upon his breast, his eyes were for a moment closed, his broad
palms were lifted and pressed against his forehead, a tremor
seized him, and he fell all in a lump to the floor. The children
ran off with their infant-loads, leaving Jules St.-Ange swearing
by all his deceased relatives, first to Miguel and Joe, and then to
the lifted parson, that he did not know what had become of the
money "except if" the black man had got it.</p>

<hr class="invis" />

<p>In the rear of ancient New Orleans, beyond the sites of the
old rampart, a trio of Spanish forts, where the town has since
sprung up and grown old, green with all the luxuriance of the
wild Creole summer, lay the Congo Plains. Here stretched the
canvas of the historic Cayetano, who Sunday after Sunday sowed
the sawdust for his circus-ring.</p>

<p>But to-day the great showman had fallen short of his printed
promise. The hurricane had come by night, and with one fell
swash had made an irretrievable sop of everything. The circus
trailed away its bedraggled magnificence, and the ring was
cleared for the bull.</p>

<p>Then the sun seemed to come out and work for the people.
"See," said the Spaniards, looking up at the glorious sky with
its great white fleets drawn off upon the horizon, "see&mdash;heaven
smiles upon the bull-fight!"</p>

<p>In the high upper seats of the rude amphitheatre sat the
gayly decked wives and daughters of the Gascons, from the
<i>mÃ©tairies</i> along the Ridge, and the chattering Spanish women of
the Market, their shining hair unbonneted to the sun. Next
below were their husbands and lovers in Sunday blouses, milkmen,
butchers, bakers, black-bearded fishermen, Sicilian fruiterers,
swarthy Portuguese sailors in little woolen caps, and
strangers of the graver sort; mariners of England, Germany, and
Holland. The lowest seats were full of trappers, smugglers,
Canadian <i>voyageurs</i>, drinking and singing; <i>AmÃ©ricains</i>, too&mdash;more's
the shame&mdash;from the upper rivers&mdash;who will not keep
their seats&mdash;who ply the bottle, and who will get home by-and-by
and tell how wicked Sodom is; broad-brimmed, silver-braided
Mexicans too, with their copper cheeks and bat's eyes, and their<span class="pagenum"><a id="page3029" name="page3029">3029</a></span>
tinkling spurred heels. Yonder in that quieter section are the
quadroon women in their black lace shawls&mdash;and there is Baptiste;
and below them are the turbaned black women, and there
is&mdash;but he vanishes&mdash;Colossus.</p>

<p>The afternoon is advancing, yet the sport, though loudly
demanded, does not begin. The <i>AmÃ©ricains</i> grow derisive and
find pastime in gibes and raillery. They mock the various
Latins with their national inflections, and answer their scowls
with laughter. Some of the more aggressive shout pretty French
greetings to the women of Gascony, and one bargeman, amid
peals of applause, stands on a seat and hurls a kiss to the
quadroons. The marines of England, Germany, and Holland, as
spectators, like the fun, while the Spaniards look black and cast
defiant imprecations upon their persecutors. Some Gascons, with
timely caution, pick their women out and depart, running a terrible
fire of gallantries.</p>

<p>In hope of truce, a new call is raised for the bull: "The
bull! the bull!&mdash;hush!"</p>

<p>In a tier near the ground a man is standing and calling&mdash;standing
head and shoulders above the rest&mdash;calling in the
<i>AmÃ©ricaine</i> tongue. Another man, big and red, named Joe, and
a handsome little Creole in elegant dress and full of laughter,
wish to stop him, but the flatboatmen, ha-ha-ing and cheering,
will not suffer it. Ah, through some shameful knavery of the
men into whose hands he has fallen, he is drunk! Even the
women can see that; and now he throws his arms wildly and
raises his voice until the whole great circle hears it. He is
preaching!</p>

<p>Ah! kind Lord, for a special providence now! The men of
his own nation&mdash;men from the land of the open English Bible
and temperance cup and song&mdash;are cheering him on to mad disgrace.
And now another call for the appointed sport is drowned
by the flatboatmen singing the ancient tune of 'Mear.' You
can hear the <span class="nowrap">words&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Old Grimes is dead, that good old soul&mdash;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>from ribald lips and throats turned brazen with laughter, from
singers who toss their hats aloft and roll in their seats; the
chorus swells to the accompaniment of a thousand <span class="nowrap">brogans&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"He used to wear an old gray coat<br /></span>
<span class="i2">All buttoned down before."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page3030" name="page3030">3030</a></span>
A ribboned man in the arena is trying to be heard, and the
Latins raise one mighty cry for silence. The big red man gets
a hand over the parson's mouth, and the ribboned man seizes his
moment.</p>

<p>"They have been endeavoring for hours," he says, "to draw
the terrible animals from their dens, but such is their strength
and fierceness, that&mdash;"</p>

<p>His voice is drowned. Enough has been heard to warrant the
inference that the beasts cannot be whipped out of the storm-drenched
cages to which menagerie-life and long starvation have
attached them, and from the roar of indignation the man of
ribbons flies. The noise increases. Men are standing up by
hundreds, and women are imploring to be let out of the turmoil.
All at once, like the bursting of a dam, the whole mass
pours down into the ring. They sweep across the arena and
over the showman's barriers. Miguel gets a frightful trampling.
Who cares for gates or doors? They tear the beasts' houses bar
from bar, and, laying hold of the gaunt buffalo, drag him forth
by feet, ears, and tail; and in the midst of the <i>mÃªlÃ©e</i>, still head
and shoulders above all, wilder, with the cup of the wicked, than
any beast, is the man of God from the Florida parishes!</p>

<p>In his arms he bore&mdash;and all the people shouted at once
when they saw it&mdash;the tiger. He had lifted it high up with its
back to his breast, his arms clasped under its shoulders; the
wretched brute had curled up caterpillar-wise, with its long tail
against its belly, and through its filed teeth grinned a fixed and
impotent wrath. And Parson Jones was shouting:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The tiger and the buffler <i>shell</i> lay down together! You dah
to say they shayn't and I'll comb you with this varmint from
head to foot! The tiger and the buffler <i>shell</i> lay down together.
They <i>shell</i>! Now, you, Joe! Behold! I am here to see it done.
The lion and the buffler <i>shell</i> lay down together!"</p>

<p>Mouthing these words again and again, the parson forced his
way through the surge in the wake of the buffalo. This creature
the Latins had secured by a lariat over his head, and were dragging
across the old rampart and into a street of the city.</p>

<p>The Northern races were trying to prevent, and there was
pommeling and knocking down, cursing and knife-drawing, until
Jules St.-Ange was quite carried away with the fun, laughed,
clapped his hands, and swore with delight, and ever kept close
to the gallant parson.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page3031" name="page3031">3031</a></span>
Joe, contrariwise, counted all this child's-play an interruption.
He had come to find Colossus and the money. In an unlucky
moment he made bold to lay hold of the parson, but a piece of
the broken barriers in the hands of a <ins class="correction" title="Standardized from 'flat-boatman'">flatboatman</ins> felled him to
the sod, the terrible crowd swept over him, the lariat was cut,
and the giant parson hurled the tiger upon the buffalo's back.
In another instant both brutes were dead at the hands of the
mob; Jones was lifted from his feet, and prating of Scripture
and the millennium, of Paul at Ephesus and Daniel in the "buffler's"
den, was borne aloft upon the shoulders of the huzzaing
<i>AmÃ©ricains</i>. Half an hour later he was sleeping heavily on the
floor of a cell in the <i>calaboza</i>.</p>

<p>When Parson Jones awoke, a bell was somewhere tolling for
midnight. Somebody was at the door of his cell with a key.
The lock grated, the door swung, the turnkey looked in and
stepped back, and a ray of moonlight fell upon M. Jules
St.-Ange. The prisoner sat upon the empty shackles and ring-bolt
in the centre of the floor.</p>

<p>"Misty Posson Jone'," said the visitor, softly.</p>

<p>"O Jools!"</p>

<p>"<i>Mais</i>, w'at de matter, Posson Jone'?"</p>

<p>"My sins, Jools, my sins!"</p>

<p>"Ah, Posson Jone', is that something to cry, because a man
get sometime a litt' bit intoxicate? <i>Mais</i>, if a man keep <i>all the
time</i> intoxicate, I think that is again' the conscien'."</p>

<p>"Jools, Jools, your eyes is darkened&mdash;oh! Jools, where's my
pore old niggah?"</p>

<p>"Posson Jone', never min'; he is wid Baptiste."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"I don' know w'ere&mdash;<i>mais</i> he is wid Baptiste. Baptiste is a
beautiful to take care of somebody."</p>

<p>"Is he as good as you, Jools?" asked Parson Jones, sincerely.</p>

<p>Jules was slightly staggered.</p>

<p>"You know, Posson Jone', you know, a nigger cannot be good
as a w'ite man&mdash;<i>mais</i> Baptiste is a good nigger."</p>

<p>The parson moaned and dropped his chin into his hands.</p>

<p>"I was to of left for home to-morrow, sun-up, on the Isabella
schooner. Pore Smyrny!" He deeply sighed.</p>

<p>"Posson Jone'," said Jules, leaning against the wall and smiling,
"I swear you is the moz funny man I ever see. If I was<span class="pagenum"><a id="page3032" name="page3032">3032</a></span>
you I would say, me, 'Ah! 'ow I am lucky! the money I los', it
was not mine, anyhow!' My faith! shall a man make hisse'f to
be the more sorry because the money he los' is not his? Me, I
would say, 'It is a specious providence.'</p>

<p>"Ah! Misty Posson Jone'," he continued, "you make a so
droll sermon ad the bull-ring. Ha! ha! I swear I thing you
can make money to preach thad sermon many time ad the
theatre St. Philippe. Hah! you is the moz brave dat I never see,
<i>mais</i> ad the same time the moz rilligious man. Where I'm goin'
to fin' one priest to make like dat? <i>Mais</i>, why you can't cheer
up an' be 'appy? Me, if I should be miserabl' like that I would
kill meself."</p>

<p>The countryman only shook his head.</p>

<p>"<i>Bien</i>, Posson Jone', I have the so good news for you."</p>

<p>The prisoner looked up with eager inquiry.</p>

<p>"Las' evening when they lock' you, I come right off at M.
De Blanc's house to get you let out of de calaboose; M. De
Blanc he is the judge. So soon I was entering&mdash;'Ah! Jules,
me boy, juz the man to make complete the game!' Posson
Jone', it was a specious providence! I win in t'ree hours more
dan six hundred dollah! Look." He produced a mass of bank-notes,
<i>bons</i>, and due-bills.</p>

<p>"And you got the pass?" asked the parson, regarding the
money with a sadness incomprehensible to Jules.</p>

<p>"It is here; it take the effect so soon the daylight."</p>

<p>"Jools, my friend, your kindness is in vain."</p>

<p>The Creole's face became a perfect blank.</p>

<p>"Because," said the parson, "for two reasons: firstly, I have
broken the laws, and ought to stand the penalty; and secondly&mdash;you
must really excuse me, Jools, you know, but the pass has
been got onfairly, I'm afeerd. You told the judge I was innocent;
and in neither case it don't become a Christian (which I
hope I can still say I am one) to 'do evil that good may come.'
I muss stay."</p>

<p>M. St.-Ange stood up aghast, and for a moment speechless,
at this exhibition of moral heroism; but an artifice was presently
hit upon. "<i>Mais</i>, Posson Jone'!"&mdash;in his old <i>falsetto</i>&mdash;"de
order&mdash;you cannot read it, it is in French&mdash;compel you to go
hout, sir!"</p>

<p>"Is that so?" cried the parson, bounding up with radiant
face&mdash;"is that so, Jools?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page3033" name="page3033">3033</a></span>
The young man nodded, smiling; but though he smiled, the
fountain of his tenderness was opened. He made the sign of the
cross as the parson knelt in prayer, and even whispered "Hail
Mary," etc., quite through, twice over.</p>

<p>Morning broke in summer glory upon a cluster of villas
behind the city, nestled under live-oaks and magnolias on the
banks of a deep bayou, and known as Suburb St. Jean.</p>

<p>With the first beam came the West-Floridian and the Creole
out upon the bank below the village. Upon the parson's arm
hung a pair of antique saddle-bags. Baptiste limped wearily
behind; both his eyes were encircled with broad blue rings, and
one cheek-bone bore the official impress of every knuckle of
Colossus's left hand. The "beautiful to take care of somebody"
had lost his charge. At mention of the negro he became wild,
and half in English, half in the "gumbo" dialect, said murderous
things. Intimidated by Jules to calmness, he became able
to speak confidently on one point; he could, would, and did
swear that Colossus had gone home to the Florida parishes; he
was almost certain; in fact, he thought so.</p>

<p>There was a clicking of pulleys as the three appeared upon
the bayou's margin, and Baptiste pointed out, in the deep
shadow of a great oak, the Isabella, moored among the bulrushes,
and just spreading her sails for departure. Moving down to
where she lay, the parson and his friend paused on the bank,
loath to say farewell.</p>

<p>"O Jools!" said the parson, "supposin' Colossus ain't gone
home! O Jools, if you'll look him out for me, I'll never forget
you&mdash;I'll never forget you, nohow, Jools. No, Jools, I never
will believe he taken that money. Yes, I know all niggahs will
steal"&mdash;he set foot upon the gang-plank&mdash;"but Colossus
wouldn't steal from me. Good-by."</p>

<p>"Misty Posson Jone'," said St.-Ange, putting his hand on
the parson's arm with genuine affection, "hol' on. You see dis
money&mdash;w'at I win las' night? Well, I win' it by a specious
providence, ain't it?"</p>

<p>"There's no tellin'," said the humbled Jones. "Providence</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Moves in a mysterious way<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His wonders to perform.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Ah!" cried the Creole, "<i>c'est</i> very true. I ged this money
in the mysterieuze way. <i>Mais</i>, if I keep dis money, you know
where it goin' be to-night?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page3034" name="page3034">3034</a></span>
"I really can't say," replied the parson.</p>

<p>"Goin' to de dev'," said the sweetly smiling young man.</p>

<p>The schooner-captain, leaning against the shrouds, and even
Baptiste, laughed outright.</p>

<p>"O Jools, you mustn't!"</p>

<p>"Well, den, w'at I shall do wid <i>it</i>?"</p>

<p>"Anything!" answered the parson; "better donate it away to
some poor man&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah! Misty Posson Jone', dat is w'at I want. You los' five
hondred dollar'&mdash;'twas me fault."</p>

<p>"No, it wa'n't, Jools."</p>

<p>"<i>Mais</i>, it was!"</p>

<p>"No!"</p>

<p>"It <i>was</i> me fault! I <i>swear</i> it was me fault! <i>Mais</i>, here is
five hundred dollar'; I wish you shall take it. Here! I don't
got no use for money.&mdash;Oh my faith! Posson Jone', you must
not begin to cry some more."</p>

<p>Parson Jones was choked with tears. When he found voice
he said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"O Jools, Jools, Jools! my pore, noble, dear, misguidened
friend! ef you hed of hed a Christian raisin'! May the Lord
show you your errors better'n I kin, and bless you for your good
intentions&mdash;oh, no! I cayn't touch that money with a ten-foot
pole; it wa'n't rightly got; you must really excuse me, my dear
friend, but I cayn't touch it."</p>

<p>St.-Ange was petrified.</p>

<p>"Good-by, dear Jools," continued the parson. "I'm in the
Lord's haynds, and he's very merciful, which I hope and trust
you'll find it out. Good-by!"&mdash;the schooner swung slowly off
before the breeze&mdash;"good-by!"</p>

<p>St.-Ange roused himself. "Posson Jone'! make me hany'ow
<i>dis</i> promise: you never, never, <i>never</i> will come back to New
Orleans."</p>

<p>"Ah, Jools, the Lord willin', I'll never leave home again!"</p>

<p>"All right!" cried the Creole; "I thing he's willin'. Adieu,
Posson Jone'. My faith'! you are the so fighting an' moz
rilligious man as I never saw! Adieu! Adieu!"</p>

<p>Baptiste uttered a cry and presently ran by his master toward
the schooner, his hands full of clods.</p>

<p>St.-Ange looked just in time to see the sable form of Colossus
of Rhodes emerge from the vessel's hold, and the pastor of
Smyrna and Bethesda seize him in his embrace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page3035" name="page3035">3035</a></span>
"O Colossus! you outlandish old nigger! Thank the Lord!
Thank the Lord!"</p>

<p>The little Creole almost wept. He ran down the tow-path,
laughing and swearing, and making confused allusion to the entire
<i>personnel</i> and furniture of the lower regions.</p>

<p>By odd fortune, at the moment that St.-Ange further demonstrated
his delight by tripping his mulatto into a bog, the
schooner came brushing along the reedy bank with a graceful
curve, the sails flapped, and the crew fell to poling her slowly
along.</p>

<p>Parson Jones was on the deck, kneeling once more in prayer.
His hat had fallen before him; behind him knelt his slave. In
thundering tones he was confessing himself "a plum fool," from
whom "the conceit had been jolted out," and who had been
made to see that even his "nigger had the longest head of the
two."</p>

<p>Colossus clasped his hands and groaned.</p>

<p>The parson prayed for a contrite heart.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" cried Colossus.</p>

<p>The master acknowledged countless mercies.</p>

<p>"Dat's so!" cried the slave.</p>

<p>The master prayed that they might still be "piled on."</p>

<p>"Glory!" cried the black man, clapping his hands; "pile on!"</p>

<p>"An' now," continued the parson, "bring this pore, back-slidin'
jackace of a parson and this pore ole fool nigger back to
thar home in peace!"</p>

<p>"Pray fo' de money!" called Colossus.</p>

<p>But the parson prayed for Jules.</p>

<p>"Pray fo' de <i>money</i>!" repeated the negro.</p>

<p>"And oh, give thy servant back that there lost money!"</p>

<p>Colossus rose stealthily, and tiptoed by his still shouting master.
St.-Ange, the captain, the crew, gazed in silent wonder at
the strategist. Pausing but an instant over the master's hat to
grin an acknowledgment of his beholders' speechless interest, he
softly placed in it the faithfully mourned and honestly prayed-for
Smyrna fund; then, saluted by the gesticulative, silent applause
of St.-Ange and the schooner-men, he resumed his first attitude
behind his roaring master.</p>

<p>"Amen!" cried Colossus, meaning to bring him to a close.</p>

<p>"Onworthy though I be&mdash;" cried Jones.</p>

<p>"<i>Amen!</i>" reiterated the negro.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page3036" name="page3036">3036</a></span>
"A-a-amen!" said Parson Jones.</p>

<p>He rose to his feet, and, stooping to take up his hat, beheld
the well-known roll. As one stunned, he gazed for a moment
upon his slave, who still knelt with clasped hands and rolling
eyeballs; but when he became aware of the laughter and cheers
that greeted him from both deck and shore, he lifted eyes and
hands to heaven, and cried like the veriest babe. And when he
looked at the roll again, and hugged and kissed it, St.-Ange
tried to raise a second shout, but choked, and the crew fell to
their poles.</p>

<p>And now up runs Baptiste, covered with slime, and prepares
to cast his projectiles. The first one fell wide of the mark; the
schooner swung round into a long reach of water, where the
breeze was in her favor; another shout of laughter drowned
the maledictions of the muddy man; the sails filled; Colossus of
Rhodes, smiling and bowing as hero of the moment, ducked as
the main boom swept round, and the schooner, leaning slightly
to the pleasant influence, rustled a moment over the bulrushes,
and then sped far away down the rippling bayou.</p>

<p>M. Jules St.-Ange stood long, gazing at the receding vessel
as it now disappeared, now reappeared beyond the tops of the
high undergrowth; but when an arm of the forest hid it finally
from sight, he turned townward, followed by that fagged-out
spaniel his servant, saying as he turned, "Baptiste?"</p>

<p>"<i>MichÃ©?</i>"</p>

<p>"You know w'at I goin' do wid dis money?"</p>

<p>"<i>Non, m'sieur.</i>"</p>

<p>"Well, you can strike me dead if I don't goin' to pay hall my
debts! <i>Allons!</i>"</p>

<p>He began a merry little song to the effect that his sweetheart
was a wine-bottle, and master and man, leaving care behind,
returned to the picturesque Rue Royale. The ways of Providence
are indeed strange. In all Parson Jones's after-life, amid the
many painful reminiscences of his visit to the City of the Plain,
the sweet knowledge was withheld from him that by the light of
the Christian virtue that shone from him even in his great fall,
Jules St.-Ange arose, and went to his father an honest man.</p>

<p class="cap_2"><span class="dcap">"Truly</span> a wonderful man was Caius Julius CÃ¦sar," says Captain
Miles Standish. Truly wonderful he was on each of his
many sides: as soldier, statesman, orator, and author, all of
the first rank&mdash;and a respectable critic, man of science and poet
besides.</p></div>

<p>As a writer of Latin prose, and as an orator, he was second to
Cicero alone in the age that is called the Ciceronian; and no third is
to be named with these two. Yet among his contemporaries his literary
power was an insignificant title to fame, compared with his
overwhelming military and political genius. Here he stood alone,
unrivaled, the most successful conqueror and civilizer of all history,
the founder of the most majestic political fabric the world has ever
seen. There have been other generals, statesmen, authors, as great
as CÃ¦sar; but the extraordinary combination of powers in this one
man goes very far toward making good the claim that he was the
most remarkable man in history.</p>

<p>He was born 100 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, a member of the great Julian <i>gens</i>, which
claimed descent from Ã†neas and Venus, the glories of which are
celebrated in Vergil's immortal epic. Thus the future leader of the
turbulent democracy, and the future despot who was to humble the
nobles of Rome, was by birth an aristocrat of bluest blood. His life
might easily have come to an untimely end in the days of Sulla's
bloody ascendency, for he was connected by marriage with Marius
and Cinna. Sulla was persuaded to spare him, but clearly saw, even
then, that "in CÃ¦sar there were many Mariuses."</p>

<p>All young Romans of rank were expected to go through a term
of at least nominal military service. CÃ¦sar's apprenticeship was in
Asia Minor in 80 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> He distinguished himself at the storming of
Mytilene, and afterwards served in Cilicia. He began his political
and oratorical career by the prosecution of Cornelius Dolabella, one
of the nobility, on a charge of extortion. About 75 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> he was
continuing his studies at Rhodes, then a famous school of eloquence.
Obtaining the quÃ¦storship in 67 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, he was assigned to duty in the
province of Further Spain. Two years later he became Ã¦dile. At
the age of thirty-seven he was elected <i>pontifex maximus</i> over two<span class="pagenum"><a id="page3038" name="page3038">3038</a></span>
powerful competitors. Entirely without religious belief, as far as we
can judge, he recognized the importance of this portion of the civil
order, and mastered the intricate lore of the established ceremonial.
In this office, which he held for life, he busied himself with a Digest
of the Auspices and wrote an essay on Divination.</p>

<p>After filling the prÃ¦torship in 62 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, he obtained, as proprÃ¦tor,
the governorship of his old province of Further Spain, which he was
destined to visit twice in later years as conqueror in civil war. His
military success at this time against the native tribes was such as to
entitle him to the honor of a triumph. This he was obliged to forego
in order to stand at once for the consulship, which office he held for
the year 59 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> He had previously entered into a private agreement
with Pompey and Crassus, known as the First Triumvirate.
CÃ¦sar had always presented himself as the friend of the people;
Pompey was the most famous man of the time, covered with military
laurels, and regarded, though not with perfect confidence, as the
champion of the Senatorial party. Crassus, a man of ordinary ability,
was valuable to the other two on account of his enormous wealth.
These three men agreed to unite their interests and their influence.
In accordance with this arrangement CÃ¦sar obtained the consulship,
and then the command for five years, afterward extended to ten, of
the provinces of Gaul and Illyricum. It was while proconsul of Gaul
in the years 58-50 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> that he subjugated and organized "All Gaul,"
which was far greater in extent than the country which is now
France; increased his own political and material resources; and above
all formed an army, the most highly trained and efficient the world
had yet seen, entirely faithful to himself, by means of which he was
able in the years 49-46 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> to defeat all his political antagonists and
to gain absolute power over the State.</p>

<p>He held the consulship again in 48 and 46 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, and was consul
without a colleague in 45 and 44 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, as well as dictator with
authority to remodel the Constitution. While his far-reaching plans
of organization and improvement were incomplete, and when he was
about to start upon a war against the Parthians on the eastern
frontier of the empire, he was murdered March 15th, 44 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, by a
band of conspirators headed by Brutus and Cassius.</p>

<p>For purposes of a literary judgment of CÃ¦sar we have of his own
works in complete or nearly complete form his military memoirs
only. His specifically literary works have all perished. A few sentences
from his speeches, a few of his letters, a few wise or witty
sayings, an anecdote or two scattered about in the pages of other
authors, and six lines of hexameter verse, containing a critical estimate
of the dramatist Terence, are all that remain as specimens of
what is probably forever lost to us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page3039" name="page3039">3039</a></span>
An enumeration of his works, so far as their titles are known, is
the best evidence of his versatility. A bit of criticism here and
there shows the estimation in which CÃ¦sar the writer and orator was
held by his countrymen and contemporaries. Besides the military
memoirs and the works spoken of above in connection with his
pontificate, we may mention, as of a semi-official character, his
astronomical treatise On the Stars (De Astris), published in connection
with his reform of the calendar, when dictator, shortly before
the end of his life.</p>

<p>Cicero alludes to a collection of witty sayings (Apophthegms) made
by CÃ¦sar, with evident satisfaction at the latter's ability to distinguish
the real and the false Ciceronian <i>bons mots</i>.</p>

<p>Like most Roman gentlemen, CÃ¦sar wrote in youth several poems,
of which Tacitus grimly says that they were not better than Cicero's.
This list includes a tragedy, '&OElig;dipus,' 'Laudes Herculis' (the
Praises of Hercules), and a metrical account of a journey into Spain
(Iter).</p>

<p>A grammatical treatise in two books (De Analogia), dedicated to
Cicero, to the latter's immense gratification, was written on one of the
numerous swift journeys from Italy to headquarters in Gaul. Passages
from it are quoted by several subsequent writers, and an anecdote
preserved by Aulus Gellius in his Noctes AtticÃ¦ I. 10. 4, wherein
a young man is warned by CÃ¦sar to avoid unusual and far-fetched
language "like a rock," is supposed to be very characteristic of his
general attitude in matters of literary taste. The 'Anticatones' were
a couple of political pamphlets ridiculing Cato, the idol of the republicans.
This was small business for CÃ¦sar, but Cato had taken
rather a mean advantage by his dramatic suicide at Utica, and
deprived CÃ¦sar of the "pleasure of pardoning him."</p>

<p>Of CÃ¦sar's orations we have none but the most insignificant fragments&mdash;our
judgment of them must be based on the testimony of
ancient critics. Quintilian speaks in the same paragraph (Quintilian
X. 1, 114) of the "wonderful elegance of his language" and
of the "force" which made it "seem that he spoke with the same
spirit with which he fought." Cicero's phrase "<i>magnifica et generosa</i>"
(Cicero, Brutus, 261), and Fronto's "<i>facultas dicendi imperatoria</i>"
(Fronto, Ep. p. 123), indicate "some kind of severe magnificence."</p>

<p>Collections of his letters were extant in the second century, but
nothing now remains except a few brief notes to Cicero, copied by
the latter in his correspondence with Atticus. This loss is perhaps
the one most to be regretted. Letters reveal their author's personality
better than more formal species of composition, and CÃ¦sar was
almost the last real letter-writer, the last who used in its perfection
the polished, cultivated, conversational language, the <i>Sermo urbanus</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page3040" name="page3040">3040</a></span>
But after all, we possess the most important of his writings,
the Commentaries on the Gallic and Civil Wars. The first may be
considered as a formal report to the Senate and the public on the
conduct of his Gallic campaigns; the latter, as primarily intended
for a defense of his constitutional position in the Civil War.</p>

<p>They are memoirs, half way between private notes and formal
history. Cicero says that while their author "desired to give others
the material out of which to create a history, he may perhaps have
done a kindness to conceited writers who wish to trick them out
with meretricious graces" (to "crimp with curling-irons"), "but he
has deterred all men of sound taste from ever touching them. For
in history a pure and brilliant conciseness of style is the highest
attainable beauty." "They are worthy of all praise, for they are
simple, straightforward and elegant, with all rhetorical ornament
stripped from them as a garment is stripped." (Cicero, Brutus, 262.)</p>

<p>The seven books of the Gallic War are each the account of a
year's campaigning. They were written apparently in winter quarters.
When CÃ¦sar entered on the administration of his province it
was threatened with invasion. The Romans had never lost their
dread of the northern barbarians, nor forgotten the capture of Rome
three centuries before. Only a generation back, Marius had become
the national hero by destroying the invading hordes of Cimbri and
Teutones. CÃ¦sar purposed to make the barbarians tremble at the
Roman name. This first book of the Commentaries tells how he
raised an army in haste, with which he outmarched, outman&oelig;uvred
and defeated the Helvetian nation. This people, urged by pressure
behind and encouragement in front, had determined to leave its old
home in the Alpine valleys and to settle in the fairer regions of
southeastern France. Surprised and dismayed by CÃ¦sar's terrific
reception of their supposed invincible host, they had to choose between
utter destruction and a tame return, with sadly diminished numbers,
to their old abodes. Nor was this all the work of the first year.
Ariovistus, a German king, also invited by a Gallic tribe, and relying
on the terror of his nation's name, came to establish himself and
his people on the Gallic side of the Rhine. He too was astonished
at the tone with which CÃ¦sar ordered him to depart, but soon found
himself forced to return far more quickly than he had come.</p>

<p>Having thus vindicated the Roman claim to the frontiers of Gaul
against other invaders, the proconsul devoted his second summer to
the subjugation of the BelgÃ¦, the most warlike and the most remote
of the Gauls. The second book tells how this was accomplished.
There was one moment when the conqueror's career came near ending
prematurely. One of the Belgian tribes, the valiant Nervii, surprised
and nearly defeated the Roman army. But steady discipline<span class="pagenum"><a id="page3041" name="page3041">3041</a></span>
and the dauntless courage of the commander, never so great as in
moments of mortal peril, saved the day, and the Nervii are immortalized
as the people who nearly destroyed CÃ¦sar.</p>

<p>These unprecedented successes all round the eastern and northern
frontiers thoroughly established Roman prestige and strengthened
Rome's supremacy over the central Gauls, who were already her
allies, at least in name. But much yet remained to do. The work
was but fairly begun. The third book tells of the conquest of the
western tribes. The most interesting episode is the creation of a
fleet and the naval victory over the Veneti on the far-away coast of
Brittany. In the fourth year CÃ¦sar crossed the Rhine, after building
a wonderful wooden bridge in ten days, carried fire and sword
among the Germans on the further bank, and returned to his side of
the river, destroying the bridge behind him. Modern schoolboys
wish he had never built it. Later in the season he made an expedition
into Britain. This was followed in the fifth year by an
invasion of the island in greater force. To people of our race this
portion of the Commentaries is especially interesting. The southern
part of the country was overrun, the Thames was crossed some miles
above London, and several victories were gained, but no organized
conquest was attempted. That remained for the age of Claudius and
later emperors.</p>

<p>During the ensuing winter, on account of the scarcity of provisions,
the Roman troops had to be quartered in separate detachments
at long distances. One of these was treacherously destroyed by the
Gauls, and the others were saved only by the extraordinary quickness
with which CÃ¦sar marched to their relief on hearing of their imminent
danger. The chief part in this rising had been taken by the
Eburones, led by their king Ambiorix. A large part of the sixth
book is occupied with the recital of CÃ¦sar's vengeance upon these
people and their abettors, and with the vain pursuit of Ambiorix.
The remainder contains an elaborate contrast of the manners and
customs of the Gauls and Germans, which forms an important source
for the history of the primitive institutions of these nations. The
seventh book is the thrilling tale of the formidable rising of all the
Gauls against their conquerors, under the leadership of Vercingetorix,
an Arvernian chief. This man was a real hero,&mdash;brave, patriotic,
resourceful, perhaps the only worthy antagonist that CÃ¦sar ever met.
This war strained to the utmost CÃ¦sar's abilities and the disciplined
valor of his legions. The Gauls nearly succeeded in undoing all the
work of six years, in destroying the Roman army and in throwing off
the Roman yoke. In this campaign, more conspicuously than ever
before, CÃ¦sar's success was due to the unexampled rapidity of his
movements. So perfect had become the training of his troops and<span class="pagenum"><a id="page3042" name="page3042">3042</a></span>
their confidence in his ability to win under all circumstances, that
after a campaign of incredible exertions they triumphed over the
countless hosts of their gallant foes, and in the next two years the
last embers of Gaulish independence were finally stamped out. In
all his later wars, CÃ¦sar never had anything to fear from Gaul. As
we read the story of Avaricum, of Gergovia, of Alesia, our sympathy
goes out to the brave barbarians who were fighting for liberty&mdash;but
we have to remember that though the cause of freedom failed, the
cause of civilization triumphed. The eighth book, containing the
account of the next two years, 51 and 50 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>, was written by one
of CÃ¦sar's officers, Aulus Hirtius.</p>

<p>The first book of the Civil War begins with the year 49 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>,
where the struggle between CÃ¦sar and the Senatorial party opens
with his crossing of the Rubicon, attended by the advanced guard of
his legions. Pompey proved a broken reed to those who leaned upon
him, and CÃ¦sar's conquest of the Italian peninsula was little else
than a triumphal progress through the country. The enemy retired
to the eastern shore of the Adriatic to muster the forces of the East
on the side of the aristocracy, leaving CÃ¦sar in possession of the
capital and of the machinery of government. The latter part of the
book contains the account of the campaign against Pompey's lieutenants
in Spain, which was won almost without bloodshed, by masterly
strategy, and which ended with the complete possession of the
peninsula. The second book describes the capture of Marseilles after
a long siege, and the tragic defeat and death of Curio, a brave but
rash young officer sent by CÃ¦sar to secure the African province. In
the third book (48 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>) we have the story of the campaign against
Pompey; first the audacious blockade for months of Pompey's greatly
superior forces near Dyrrachium on the Illyrian coast; and when that
failed, of the long march into Thessaly, where Pompey was at last
forced into battle, against his judgment, by his own officers, on the
fatal plains of Pharsalia; of the annihilation of the Senatorial army;
of Pompey's flight to Egypt; of his treacherous murder there; of
CÃ¦sar's pursuit. The books on the Alexandrian, the African, and the
Spanish wars, which continue the narrative down to CÃ¦sar's final victory
at Munda in southern Spain, are by other and inferior hands.
The question of their authorship has been the subject of much controversy
and conjecture.</p>

<p>Under this modest title of 'Commentaries,' in the guise of a
simple narrative of events, CÃ¦sar puts forth at once an inimitable
history and a masterly apology. The author speaks of himself in
the third person, tells of the circumstances of each situation in a
quiet moderate way, which carries with it the conviction on the
reader's part of his entire truthfulness, accuracy, and candor. We<span class="pagenum"><a id="page3043" name="page3043">3043</a></span>
are persuaded that the CÃ¦sar about whom he tells could not have
acted otherwise than he did. In short, he exercises the same spell
over our minds that he cast over the hearts of men twenty centuries
ago.</p>

<p>There is nothing that so fascinates and enchains the imagination
of men as power in another man. This man could captivate a
woman by his sweetness or tame an angry mob of soldiers with a
word; could mold the passions of a corrupt democracy or exterminate
a nation in a day; could organize an empire or polish an epigram.
His strength was terrible. But all this immense power was
marvelously balanced and under perfect control. Nothing was too
small for his delicate tact. Nothing that he did was so difficult but
we feel he could have done more. Usually his means seemed inadequate
to his ends. But it was CÃ¦sar who used them.</p>

<p>The Commentaries show us this man at his work. They show
him as an organizer of armies and alliances, a wily diplomatist, an
intrepid soldier, an efficient administrator, a strategist of inspired
audacity, a tactician of endless resources, an engineer of infinite
inventiveness, an unerring judge of men. But he never boasts,
except in speeches to hearten discouraged troops. He does not vilify
or underrate his enemies.</p>

<p>His soldiers trusted him implicitly; there was no limit to their
zeal. They found in him a generous appreciation of their deeds.
Many a soldier and centurion has received immortality at his hands
as the guerdon of valor. He describes a victory of Labienus with as
much satisfaction as if it had been his own, and praises another
lieutenant for his prudent self-restraint when tempted by a prospect
of success. And he tells with hearty admiration of the devoted
Gauls who sacrificed their lives one after another in a post of danger
at Avaricum. Even in the Civil War no officers deserted him
except Labienus and two Gaulish chiefs.</p>

<p>It was difficult to deceive him. His analysis of other men's
motives is as merciless as it is passionless. He makes us disapprove
the course of his antagonists with the same moderate but convincing
statement with which he recommends his own. Few men can have
had as few illusions as he. One would scarcely care to possess such
an insight into the hearts of others. He seems to feel little warmth
of indignation, and never indulges in invective. But woe to those
who stood in the way of the accomplishment of his objects. Dreadful
was the punishment of those who revolted after making peace.
Still, even his vengeance seems dictated by policy rather than by
passion. He is charged with awful cruelty because he slew a million
men and sold another million into slavery. But he did not enjoy
human suffering. These were simply necessary incidents in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page3044" name="page3044">3044</a></span>
execution of his plans. It is hard to see how European civilization
could have proceeded without the conquest of Gaul, and it is surely
better to make a conquest complete, rapid, overpowering, that the
work may have to be done but once.</p>

<p>It is hard not to judge men by the standards of our own age.
The ancients rarely felt an international humanity, and in his own
time "CÃ¦sar's clemency" was proverbial. As he was always careful
not to waste in useless fighting the lives of his soldiers, so he was
always true to his own precept, "Spare the citizens." The way in
which he repeatedly forgave his enemies when they were in his
power was an example to many a Christian conqueror. The best of
his antagonists showed themselves bloodthirsty in word or act; and
most of them, not excepting Cicero, were basely ungrateful for his
forbearance. His treatment of Cicero was certainly most handsome&mdash;our
knowledge of it is derived mainly from Cicero's letters. Perhaps
this magnanimity was dashed with a tinge of kindly contempt
for his fellow-citizens; but whatever its motives, it was certainly wise
and benign at the beginning of the new era he was inaugurating.
He was no vulgar destroyer, and did not desire to ruin in order to
rule.</p>

<p>He is charged with ambition, the sin by which the angels fell. It
is not for us to fathom the depths of his mighty mind. Let us
admit the charge. But it was not an ignoble ambition. Let us say
that he was so ambitious that he laid the foundations of the Roman
Empire and of modern France; that his services to civilization and
his plans for humanity were so broad that patriots were driven to
murder him.</p>

<p>Some of CÃ¦sar's eulogists have claimed for him a moral greatness
corresponding to his transcendent mental power. This is mistaken
zeal. He may stand as the supreme representative of the race in the
way of practical executive intellect. It is poor praise to put him
into another order of men, with Plato or with Paul. Their greatness
was of another kind. We cannot speak of degrees. He is the exponent
of creative force in political history&mdash;not of speculative or
ethical power.</p>

<p>Moreover, with all his originality of conception and power of execution,
CÃ¦sar lacked that kind of imagination which makes the true
poet, the real creative artist in literature. Thus we observe the
entire absence of the pictorial element in his writings. There is no
trace of his ever being affected by the spectacular incidents of warfare
nor by the grandeur of the natural scenes through which he
passed. The reason may be that his intellect was absorbed in the
contemplation of men and motives, of means and ends. We cannot
conceive of his ever having been carried out of himself by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page3045" name="page3045">3045</a></span>
rapture of inspiration. Such clearness of mental perception is naturally
accompanied by a certain coolness of temperament. A man of
superlative greatness must live more or less alone among his fellows.
With his immense grasp of the relations of things in the world,
CÃ¦sar cannot have failed to regard men to some extent as the
counters in a great game&mdash;himself the player. So he used men,
finding them instruments&mdash;efficient and zealous, often&mdash;of his far-reaching
plans. He was just in rewarding their services&mdash;more than
just: he was generous and kind. But he did not have real associates,
real friends; therefore it is not surprising that he met with so
little gratitude. Even his diction shows this independence, this isolation.
It would be difficult to find an author of any nation in a
cultivated age so free from the influence of the language of his
predecessors. CÃ¦sar was unique among the great Roman writers in
having been born at the capital. Appropriately he is the incarnation
of the specifically Roman spirit in literature, as Cicero was the embodiment
of the Italian, the Hellenic, the cosmopolitan spirit.</p>

<p>Toward the close of CÃ¦sar's career there are some signs of weariness
observable&mdash;a certain loss of serenity, a suspicion of vanity, a
dimming of his penetrating vision into the men about him. The
only wonder is that mind and body had not succumbed long before
to the prodigious strain put upon them. Perhaps it is well that he
died when he did, hardly past his prime. So he went to his setting,
like the other "weary Titan," leaving behind him a brightness which
lasted all through the night of the Dark Ages. CÃ¦sar died, but the
imperial idea of which he was the first embodiment has proved the
central force of European political history even down to our time.</p>

<p>Such is the man who speaks to us from his pages still. He was a
man who did things rather than a man who said things. Yet who
could speak so well? His mastery of language was perfect, but in
the same way as his mastery of other instruments. Style with him
was a means rather than an end. He had the training which others
of his kind enjoyed. Every Roman noble had to learn oratory. But
CÃ¦sar wrote and spoke with a faultless taste and a distinction that
no training could impart. So we find in his style a beauty which
does not depend upon ornament, but upon perfect proportion; a diction
plain and severe almost to baldness; absolute temperateness of
expression. The descriptions are spirited, but never made so by
strained rhetoric; the speeches are brief, manly, business-like; the
arguments calm and convincing; always and everywhere the language
of a strong man well inside the limits of his power.</p>

<p>The chief ancient authorities for the life of CÃ¦sar, besides his
own works, are Suetonius in Latin, Plutarch and Appian in Greek.
Among modern works of which he is made the subject may be<span class="pagenum"><a id="page3046" name="page3046">3046</a></span>
mentioned 'Jules CÃ©sar,' by Napoleon III. (Paris, 1865); continued by
Colonel Stoffel, with an Atlas; 'CÃ¦sar, a Sketch,' by J.&nbsp;A. Froude
(London, 1886); 'CÃ¦sar,' by A. Trollope (London, 1870); 'CÃ¦sar,' by
T.&nbsp;A. Dodge, U.S.A. (Boston, 1893).</p>

<h3><a name="THE_DEFEAT_OF_ARIOVISTUS_AND_THE_GERMANS" id="THE_DEFEAT_OF_ARIOVISTUS_AND_THE_GERMANS"></a>THE DEFEAT OF ARIOVISTUS AND THE GERMANS</h3>

<p class="subtitle">From 'The Gallic Wars'</p>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="dcap">When</span> he had proceeded three days' journey, word was
brought to him that Ariovistus was hastening with all
his forces to seize on Vesontio,<a name="Anchor-115" id="Anchor-115"></a><a title="Go to footnote 115" href="#Footnote-115" class="fnanchor">115</a> which is the largest
town of the Sequani, and had advanced three days' journey from
his territories. CÃ¦sar thought that he ought to take the greatest
precautions lest this should happen, for there was in that town
a most ample supply of everything which was serviceable for
war; and so fortified was it by the nature of the ground as to
afford a great facility for protracting the war, inasmuch as the
river Doubs almost surrounds the whole town, as though it were
traced round with a pair of compasses. A mountain of great
height shuts in the remaining space, which is not more than six
hundred feet, where the river leaves a gap in such a manner
that the roots of that mountain extend to the river's bank on
either side. A wall thrown around it makes a citadel of this
mountain, and connects it with the town. Hither CÃ¦sar hastens
by forced marches by night and day, and after having seized
the town, stations a garrison there.</p>

<p>Whilst he is tarrying a few days at Vesontio, on account of
corn and provisions; from the inquiries of our men and the
reports of the Gauls and traders (who asserted that the Germans
were men of huge stature, of incredible valor and practice
in arms,&mdash;that ofttimes they, on encountering them, could not
bear even their countenance and the fierceness of their eyes),
so great a panic on a sudden seized the whole army, as to discompose
the minds and spirits of all in no slight degree. This<span class="pagenum"><a id="page3047" name="page3047">3047</a></span>
first arose from the tribunes of the soldiers, the prefects and the
rest, who, having followed CÃ¦sar from the city [Rome] from
motives of friendship, had no great experience in military affairs.
And alleging, some of them one reason, some another, which
they said made it necessary for them to depart, they requested
that by his consent they might be allowed to withdraw; some,
influenced by shame, stayed behind in order that they might
avoid the suspicion of cowardice. These could neither compose
their countenance, nor even sometimes check their tears: but
hidden in their tents, either bewailed their fate or deplored with
their comrades the general danger. Wills were sealed universally
throughout the whole camp. By the expressions and cowardice
of these men, even those who possessed great experience in the
camp, both soldiers and centurions, and those [the decurions]
who were in command of the cavalry, were gradually disconcerted.
Such of them as wished to be considered less alarmed
said that they did not dread the enemy, but feared the narrowness
of the roads and the vastness of the forests which lay
between them and Ariovistus, or else that the supplies could not
be brought up readily enough. Some even declared to CÃ¦sar
that when he gave orders for the camp to be moved and the
troops to advance, the soldiers would not be obedient to the
command nor advance, in consequence of their fear.</p>

<p>When CÃ¦sar observed these things, having called a council,
and summoned to it the centurions of all the companies, he
severely reprimanded them, "particularly for supposing that it
belonged to them to inquire or conjecture either in what
direction they were marching or with what object. That Ariovistus
during his [CÃ¦sar's] consulship had most anxiously
sought after the friendship of the Roman people; why should
any one judge that he would so rashly depart from his duty?
He for his part was persuaded that when his demands were
known and the fairness of the terms considered, he would reject
neither his nor the Roman people's favor. But even if, driven
on by rage and madness, he should make war upon them, what
after all were they afraid of?&mdash;or why should they despair
either of their own valor or of his zeal? Of that enemy a trial
had been made within our fathers' recollection, when on the
defeat of the Cimbri and Teutones by Caius Marius, the army
was regarded as having deserved no less praise than their commander
himself. It had been made lately too in Italy, during<span class="pagenum"><a id="page3048" name="page3048">3048</a></span>
the rebellion of the slaves, whom, however, the experience and
training which they had received from us assisted in some
respect. From which a judgment might be formed of the
advantages which resolution carries with it,&mdash;inasmuch as those
whom for some time they had groundlessly dreaded when
unarmed, they had afterwards vanquished when well armed and
flushed with success. In short, that these were the same men
whom the Helvetii, in frequent encounters, not only in their
own territories, but also in theirs [the German], have generally
vanquished, and yet cannot have been a match for our army. If
the unsuccessful battle and flight of the Gauls disquieted any,
these, if they made inquiries, might discover that when the
Gauls had been tired out by the long duration of the war, Ariovistus,
after he had many months kept himself in his camp and
in the marshes, and had given no opportunity for an engagement,
fell suddenly upon them, by this time despairing of a
battle and scattered in all directions; and was victorious more
through stratagem and cunning than valor. But though there
had been room for such stratagem against savage and unskilled
men, not even Ariovistus himself expected that thereby our
armies could be entrapped. That those who ascribed their fear
to a pretense about the deficiency of supplies and the narrowness
of the roads acted presumptuously, as they seemed either
to distrust their general's discharge of his duty or to dictate
to him. That these things were his concern; that the Sequani,
the Leuci, and the Lingones were to furnish the corn; and that
it was already ripe in the fields; that as to the road, they
would soon be able to judge for themselves. As to its being
reported that the soldiers would not be obedient to command,
or advance, he was not at all disturbed at that; for he knew
that in the case of all those whose army had not been obedient
to command, either upon some mismanagement of an affair fortune
had deserted them, or that upon some crime being discovered
covetousness had been clearly proved against them. His
integrity had been seen throughout his whole life, his good
fortune in the war with the Helvetii. That he would therefore
instantly set about what he had intended to put off till a more
distant day, and would break up his camp the next night in
the fourth watch, that he might ascertain as soon as possible
whether a sense of honor and duty, or whether fear, had more
influence with them. But that if no one else should follow, yet<span class="pagenum"><a id="page3049" name="page3049">3049</a></span>
he would go with only the tenth legion, of which he had no
misgivings, and it should be his prÃ¦torian cohort."&mdash;This legion
CÃ¦sar had both greatly favored, and in it, on account of its
valor, placed the greatest confidence.</p>

<p>Upon the delivery of this speech, the minds of all were
changed in a surprising manner, and the highest ardor and
eagerness for prosecuting the war were engendered; and the
tenth legion was the first to return thanks to him, through
their military tribunes, for his having expressed this most
favorable opinion of them; and assured him that they were
quite ready to prosecute the war. Then the other legions
endeavored, through their military tribunes and the centurions
of the principal companies, to excuse themselves to CÃ¦sar,
saying that they had never either doubted or feared, or supposed
that the determination of the conduct of the war was
theirs and not their general's. Having accepted their excuse,
and having had the road carefully reconnoitred by Divitiacus,
because in him of all others he had the greatest faith, he found
that by a circuitous route of more than fifty miles he might
lead his army through open parts; he then set out in the fourth
watch, as he had said he would. On the seventh day, as he did
not discontinue his march, he was informed by scouts that the
forces of Ariovistus were only four-and-twenty miles distant
from ours.</p>

<p>Upon being apprised of CÃ¦sar's arrival, Ariovistus sends ambassadors
to him, saying that what he had before requested as
to a conference might now, as far as his permission went, take
place, since he [CÃ¦sar] had approached nearer; and he considered
that he might now do it without danger. CÃ¦sar did not reject
the proposal, and began to think that he was now returning to a
rational state of mind, as he voluntarily proffered that which he
had previously refused to him when he requested it; and was
in great hopes that, in consideration of his own and the Roman
people's great favors towards him, the issue would be that he
would desist from his obstinacy upon his demands being made
known. The fifth day after that was appointed as the day of
conference. Meanwhile, as ambassadors were being often sent to
and fro between them, Ariovistus demanded that CÃ¦sar should
not bring any foot-soldier with him to the conference, saying
that "he was afraid of being ensnared by him through treachery;
that both should come accompanied by cavalry; that he would<span class="pagenum"><a id="page3050" name="page3050">3050</a></span>
not come on any other condition." CÃ¦sar, as he neither wished
that the conference should, by an excuse thrown in the way, be
set aside, nor durst trust his life to the cavalry of the Gauls,
decided that it would be most expedient to take away from the
Gallic cavalry all their horses, and thereon to mount the legionary
soldiers of the tenth legion, in which he placed the greatest confidence;
in order that he might have a body-guard as trustworthy
as possible, should there be any need for action. And when this
was done, one of the soldiers of the tenth legion said, not without
a touch of humor, "that CÃ¦sar did more for them than he had
promised: he had promised to have the tenth legion in place of
his prÃ¦torian cohort; but he now converted them into horse."</p>

<p>There was a large plain, and in it a mound of earth of considerable
size. This spot was at nearly an equal distance from both
camps. Thither, as had been appointed, they came for the conference.
CÃ¦sar stationed the legion which he had brought with
him on horseback, two hundred paces from this mound. The
cavalry of Ariovistus also took their stand at an equal distance.
Ariovistus then demanded that they should confer on horseback,
and that, besides themselves, they should bring with them ten
men each to the conference. When they were come to the place,
CÃ¦sar, in the opening of his speech, detailed his own and the
Senate's favors towards him [Ariovistus], "in that he had been
styled king, in that he had been styled friend, by the Senate,&mdash;in
that very considerable presents had been sent him; which circumstance
he informed him had both fallen to the lot of few, and
had usually been bestowed in consideration of important personal
services; that he, although he had neither an introduction, nor a
just ground for the request, had obtained these honors through
the kindness and munificence of himself [CÃ¦sar] and the Senate.
He informed him, too, how old and how just were the grounds
of connection that existed between themselves [the Romans] and
the Ã†dui, what decrees of the Senate had been passed in their
favor, and how frequent and how honorable; how from time
immemorial the Ã†dui had held the supremacy of the whole of
Gaul; even, said CÃ¦sar, before they had sought <i>our</i> friendship;
that it was the custom of the Roman people to desire not only
that its allies and friends should lose none of their property, but
be advanced in influence, dignity, and honor: who then could
endure that what they had brought with them to the friendship
of the Roman people should be torn from them?" He then<span class="pagenum"><a id="page3051" name="page3051">3051</a></span>
made the same demands which he had commissioned the ambassadors
to make, that Ariovistus should not make war either
upon the Ã†dui or their allies; that he should restore the hostages;
that if he could not send back to their country any part of the
Germans, he should at all events suffer none of them any more
to cross the Rhine.</p>

<p>Ariovistus replied briefly to the demands of CÃ¦sar, but expatiated
largely on his own virtues: "that he had crossed the Rhine
not of his own accord, but on being invited and sent for by the
Gauls; that he had not left home and kindred without great
expectations and great rewards; that he had settlements in Gaul,
granted by the Gauls themselves; that the hostages had been
given by their own good-will; that he took by right of war the
tribute which conquerors are accustomed to impose on the conquered;
that he had not made war upon the Gauls, but the Gauls
upon him; that all the States of Gaul came to attack him, and
had encamped against him; that all their forces had been routed
and beaten by him in a single battle; that if they chose to make
a second trial, he was ready to encounter them again; but if they
chose to enjoy peace, it was unfair to refuse the tribute which
of their own free-will they had paid up to that time. That the
friendship of the Roman people ought to prove to him an ornament
and a safeguard, not a detriment; and that he sought it
with that expectation. But if through the Roman people the
tribute was to be discontinued, and those who surrendered to be
seduced from him, he would renounce the friendship of the
Roman people no less heartily than he had sought it. As to his
leading over a host of Germans into Gaul, that he was doing this
with a view of securing himself, not of assaulting Gaul: that
there was evidence of this, in that he did not come without being
invited, and in that he did not make war, but merely warded it
off. That he had come into Gaul before the Roman people.
That never before this time did a Roman army go beyond the
frontiers of the province of Gaul. What, said he, does CÃ¦sar
desire?&mdash;why come into his [Ariovistus's] domains?&mdash;that this
was his province of Gaul, just as that is ours. As it ought not
to be pardoned in him if he were to make an attack upon our
territories, so likewise that we were unjust to obstruct him in
his prerogative. As for CÃ¦sar's saying that the Ã†dui had been
styled 'brethren' by the Senate, he was not so uncivilized nor
so ignorant of affairs as not to know that the Ã†dui in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page3052" name="page3052">3052</a></span>
very last war with the Allobroges had neither rendered assistance
to the Romans nor received any from the Roman people in the
struggles which the Ã†dui had been maintaining with him and
with the Sequani. He must feel suspicious that CÃ¦sar, though
feigning friendship as the reason for his keeping an army in
Gaul, was keeping it with the view of crushing him. And that
unless he depart and withdraw his army from these parts, he
shall regard him not as a friend, but as a foe; and that even if
he should put him to death, he should do what would please
many of the nobles and leading men of the Roman people; he
had assurance of that from themselves through their messengers,
and could purchase the favor and the friendship of them all by
his [CÃ¦sar's] death. But if he would depart and resign to him
the free possession of Gaul, he would recompense him with a
great reward, and would bring to a close whatever wars he wished
to be carried on, without any trouble or risk to him."</p>

<p>Many things were stated by CÃ¦sar to the following effect:&mdash;"That
he could not waive the business, and that neither his nor
the Roman people's practice would suffer him to abandon most
meritorious allies; nor did he deem that Gaul belonged to Ariovistus
rather than to the Roman people; that the Arverni<a name="Anchor-116" id="Anchor-116"></a><a title="Go to footnote 116" href="#Footnote-116" class="fnanchor">116</a> and
the Ruteni<a name="Anchor-117" id="Anchor-117"></a><a title="Go to footnote 117" href="#Footnote-117" class="fnanchor">117</a> had been subdued in war by Quintus Fabius Maximus,
and that the Roman people had pardoned them and had
not reduced them into a province or imposed a tribute upon
them. And if the most ancient period was to be regarded,
then was the sovereignty of the Roman people in Gaul most just:
if the decree of the Senate was to be observed, then ought Gaul
to be free, which they [the Romans] had conquered in war, and
had permitted to enjoy its own laws."</p>

<p>While these things were being transacted in the conference, it
was announced to CÃ¦sar that the cavalry of Ariovistus were
approaching nearer the mound, and were riding up to our men
and casting stones and weapons at them. CÃ¦sar made an end
of his speech and betook himself to his men; and commanded
them that they should by no means return a weapon upon the
enemy. For though he saw that an engagement with the cavalry
would be without any danger to his chosen legion, yet he did not
think proper to engage, lest after the enemy were routed it
might be said that they had been ensnared by him under the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page3053" name="page3053">3053</a></span>
sanction of a conference. When it was spread abroad among the
common soldiery with what haughtiness Ariovistus had behaved
at the conference, and how he had ordered the Romans to quit
Gaul, and how his cavalry had made an attack upon our men,
and how this had broken off the conference, a much greater
alacrity and eagerness for battle was infused into our army.</p>

<p>Two days after, Ariovistus sends ambassadors to CÃ¦sar to
state that "he wished to treat with him about those things which
had been begun to be treated of between them, but had not
been concluded"; and to beg that "he would either again
appoint a day for a conference, or if he were not willing to do
that, that he would send one of his officers as an ambassador to
him." There did not appear to CÃ¦sar any good reason for
holding a conference; and the more so as the day before, the
Germans could not be restrained from casting weapons at our
men. He thought he should not without great danger send to
him as ambassador one of his Roman officers, and should expose
him to savage men. It seemed therefore most proper to send
to him C. Valerius Procillus, the son of C. Valerius Caburus, a
young man of the highest courage and accomplishments (whose
father had been presented with the freedom of the city by C.
Valerius Flaccus), both on account of his fidelity and on account
of his knowledge of the Gallic language,&mdash;which Ariovistus, by
long practice, now spoke fluently,&mdash;and because in his case the
Germans would have no motive for committing violence;<a name="Anchor-118" id="Anchor-118"></a><a title="Go to footnote 118" href="#Footnote-118" class="fnanchor">118</a> and
for his colleague, M. Mettius, who had shared the hospitality of
Ariovistus. He commissioned them to learn what Ariovistus had
to say, and to report to him. But when Ariovistus saw them
before him in his camp, he cried out in the presence of his
army, "Why were they come to him? was it for the purpose of
acting as spies?" He stopped them when attempting to speak,
and cast them into chains.</p>

<p>The same day he moved his camp forward and pitched under
a hill six miles from CÃ¦sar's camp. The day following he led his
forces past CÃ¦sar's camp, and encamped two miles beyond him;
with this design&mdash;that he might cut off CÃ¦sar from the corn
and provisions which might be conveyed to him from the Sequani
and the Ã†dui. For five successive days from that day
CÃ¦sar drew out his forces before the camp and put them in<span class="pagenum"><a id="page3054" name="page3054">3054</a></span>
battle order, that if Ariovistus should be willing to engage in
battle, an opportunity might not be wanting to him. Ariovistus
all this time kept his army in camp, but engaged daily in cavalry
skirmishes. The method of battle in which the Germans had
practiced themselves was this: There were six thousand horse,
and as many very active and courageous foot, one of whom each
of the horse selected out of the whole army for his own protection.
By these men they were constantly accompanied in their
engagements; to these the horse retired; these on any emergency
rushed forward; if any one, upon receiving a very severe
wound, had fallen from his horse, they stood around him; if it
was necessary to advance farther than usual or to retreat more
rapidly, so great, from practice, was their swiftness, that supported
by the manes of the horses they could keep pace with
their speed.</p>

<p>Perceiving that Ariovistus kept himself in camp, CÃ¦sar, that
he might not any longer be cut off from provisions, chose a
convenient position for a camp beyond that place in which the
Germans had encamped, at about six hundred paces from them,
and having drawn up his army in three lines, marched to that
place. He ordered the first and second lines to be under arms;
the third to fortify the camp. This place was distant from the
enemy about six hundred paces, as has been stated. Thither
Ariovistus sent light troops, about sixteen thousand men in number,
with all his cavalry; which forces were to intimidate our
men and hinder them in their fortification. CÃ¦sar nevertheless,
as he had before arranged, ordered two lines to drive off the
enemy; the third to execute the work. The camp being fortified,
he left there two legions and a portion of the auxiliaries, and led
back the other four legions into the larger camp.</p>

<p>The next day, according to his custom, CÃ¦sar led out his
forces from both camps, and having advanced a little from the
larger one, drew up his line of battle, and gave the enemy an
opportunity of fighting. When he found that they did not even
then come out from their intrenchments, he led back his army
into camp about noon. Then at last Ariovistus sent part of his
forces to attack the lesser camp. The battle was vigorously
maintained on both sides till the evening. At sunset, after
many wounds had been inflicted and received, Ariovistus led back
his forces into camp. When CÃ¦sar inquired of his prisoners
wherefore Ariovistus did not come to an engagement, he dis<span class="pagenum"><a id="page3055" name="page3055">3055</a></span>covered
this to be the reason&mdash;that among the Germans it was
the custom for their matrons to pronounce from lots and divination
whether it were expedient that the battle should be
engaged in or not; that they had said that "it was not the will
of heaven that the Germans should conquer, if they engaged in
battle before the new moon."</p>

<p>The day following, CÃ¦sar left what seemed sufficient as a
guard for both camps; and then drew up all the auxiliaries in
sight of the enemy, before the lesser camp, because he was not
very powerful in the number of legionary soldiers, considering
the number of the enemy; that thereby he might make use of
his auxiliaries for appearance. He himself, having drawn up his
army in three lines, advanced to the camp of the enemy. Then
at last of necessity the Germans drew their forces out of camp
and disposed them canton by canton, at equal distances, the
Harudes, Marcomanni, Tribocci, Vangiones, Nemetes, Sedusii,
Suevi; and surrounded their whole army with their chariots and
wagons, that no hope might be left in flight. On these they
placed their women, who, with disheveled hair and in tears,
entreated the soldiers, as they went forward to battle, not to
deliver them into slavery to the Romans.</p>

<p>CÃ¦sar appointed over each legion a lieutenant and a quÃ¦stor,
that every one might have them as witnesses of his valor. He
himself began the battle at the head of the right wing, because
he had observed that part of the enemy to be the least strong.
Accordingly our men, upon the signal being given, vigorously
made an attack upon the enemy, and the enemy so suddenly
and rapidly rushed forward that there was no time for casting
the javelins at them. Throwing aside, therefore, their javelins,
they fought with swords hand to hand. But the Germans,
according to their custom, rapidly forming a phalanx, sustained
the attack of our swords. There were found very many of our
soldiers who leaped upon the phalanx, and with their hands
tore away the shields and wounded the enemy from above.
Although the army of the enemy was routed on the left wing
and put to flight, they still pressed heavily on our men from the
right wing, by the great number of their troops. On observing
this, P. Crassus the Younger, who commanded the cavalry,&mdash;as
he was more disengaged than those who were employed in
the fight,&mdash;sent the third line as a relief to our men who were
in distress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page3056" name="page3056">3056</a></span>
Thereupon the engagement was renewed, and all the enemy
turned their backs, nor did they cease to flee until they arrived
at the river Rhine, about fifty miles from that place. There
some few, either relying on their strength, endeavored to swim
over, or finding boats procured their safety. Among the latter
was Ariovistus, who, meeting with a small vessel tied to the
bank, escaped in it: our horse pursued and slew all the rest of
them. Ariovistus had two wives, one a Suevan by nation, whom
he had brought with him from home; the other a Norican, the
sister of King Vocion, whom he had married in Gaul, she having
been sent thither for that purpose by her brother. Both perished
in that flight. Of their two daughters, one was slain, the
other captured. C. Valerius Procillus, as he was being dragged
by his guards in the flight, bound with a triple chain, fell into the
hands of CÃ¦sar himself, as he was pursuing the enemy with his
cavalry. This circumstance indeed afforded CÃ¦sar no less pleasure
than the victory itself; because he saw a man of the first rank in
the province of Gaul, his intimate acquaintance and friend,
rescued from the hand of the enemy and restored to him, and
that fortune had not diminished aught of the joy and exultation
of that day by his destruction. He [Procillus] said that in his
own presence the lots had been thrice consulted respecting him,
whether he should immediately be put to death by fire or be
reserved for another time: that by the favor of the lots he was
uninjured. M. Mettius also was found and brought back to him
[CÃ¦sar].</p>

<p>This battle having been reported beyond the Rhine, the
Suevi, who had come to the banks of that river, began to return
home; when the Ubii,<a name="Anchor-119" id="Anchor-119"></a><a title="Go to footnote 119" href="#Footnote-119" class="fnanchor">119</a> who dwelt nearest to the Rhine, pursuing
them while much alarmed, slew a great number of them. CÃ¦sar,
having concluded two very important wars in one campaign, conducted
his army into winter quarters among the Sequani a little
earlier than the season of the year required. He appointed
Labienus over the winter quarters, and set out in person for
hither Gaul to hold the assizes.</p>

GERMANS</h3>

<p class="subtitle">From 'The Gallic Wars'</p>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="dcap">Since</span> we have come to this place, it does not appear to be
foreign to our subject to lay before the reader an account
of the manners of Gaul and Germany, and wherein these
nations differ from each other. In Gaul there are factions not
only in all the States, and in all the cantons and their divisions,
but almost in each family; and of these factions those are the
leaders who are considered according to their judgment to
possess the greatest influence, upon whose will and determination
the management of all affairs and measures depends. And that
seems to have been instituted in ancient times with this view,
that no one of the common people should be in want of support
against one more powerful; for none of those leaders suffers
his party to be oppressed and defrauded, and if he do otherwise,
he has no influence among his party. This same policy exists
throughout the whole of Gaul; for all the States are divided into
two factions.</p>

<p>When CÃ¦sar arrived in Gaul, the Ã†dui were the leaders of
one faction, the Sequani of the other. Since the latter were less
powerful by themselves, inasmuch as the chief influence was
from of old among the Ã†dui, and their dependencies were great,
they had united to themselves the Germans and Ariovistus, and
had brought them over to their party by great sacrifices and
promises. And having fought several successful battles and slain
all the nobility of the Ã†dui, they had so far surpassed them in
power that they brought over from the Ã†dui to themselves a
large portion of their dependants, and received from them the
sons of their leading men as hostages, and compelled them to
swear in their public character that they would enter into no
design against them; and held a portion of the neighboring land,
seized on by force, and possessed the sovereignty of the whole
of Gaul. Divitiacus, urged by this necessity, had proceeded to
Rome to the Senate for the purpose of entreating assistance, and
had returned without accomplishing his object. A change of
affairs ensued on the arrival of CÃ¦sar: the hostages were returned
to the Ã†dui, their old dependencies restored, and new
ones acquired through CÃ¦sar (because those who had attached<span class="pagenum"><a id="page3058" name="page3058">3058</a></span>
themselves to their alliance saw that they enjoyed a better state
and a milder government); their other interests, their influence,
their reputation were likewise increased, and in consequence the
Sequani lost the sovereignty. The Remi succeeded to their place,
and as it was perceived that they equaled the Ã†dui in favor
with CÃ¦sar, those who on account of their old animosities could
by no means coalesce with the Ã†dui, consigned themselves in
clientship to the Remi. The latter carefully protected them. Thus
they possessed both a new and suddenly acquired influence.
Affairs were then in that position, that the Ã†dui were considered
by far the leading people, and the Remi held the second post of
honor.</p>

<p>Throughout all Gaul there are two orders of those men who
are of any rank and dignity: for the commonalty is held almost
in the condition of slaves, and dares to undertake nothing of
itself and is admitted to no deliberation. The greater part, when
they are pressed either by debt, or the large amount of their
tributes, or the oppression of the more powerful, give themselves
up in vassalage to the nobles, who possess over them the same
rights, without exception, as masters over their slaves. But of
these two orders, one is that of the Druids, the other that of the
knights. The former are engaged in things sacred, conduct the
public and the private sacrifices, and interpret all matters of
religion. To these a large number of the young men resort for
the purpose of instruction, and they [the Druids] are in great
honor among them. For they determine respecting almost all
controversies, public and private; and if any crime has been perpetrated,
if murder has been committed, if there be any dispute
about an inheritance, if any about boundaries, these same persons
decide it; they decree rewards and punishments; if any one,
either in a private or public capacity, has not submitted to their
decision, they interdict him from the sacrifices. This among
them is the most heavy punishment. Those who have been thus
interdicted are esteemed in the number of the impious and criminal:
all shun them, and avoid their society and conversation,
lest they receive some evil from their contact; nor is justice
administered to them when seeking it, nor is any dignity bestowed
on them. Over all these Druids one presides, who
possesses supreme authority among them. Upon his death, if any
individual among the rest is pre-eminent in dignity, he succeeds;
but if there are many equal, the election is made by the suffrages<span class="pagenum"><a id="page3059" name="page3059">3059</a></span>
of the Druids; sometimes they even contend for the presidency
with arms. These assemble at a fixed period of the year in a
consecrated place in the territories of the Carnutes, which is
reckoned the central region of the whole of Gaul. Hither all
who have disputes assemble from every part and submit to their
decrees and determinations. This institution is supposed to have
been devised in Britain, and to have been brought over from it
into Gaul; and now those who desire to gain a more accurate
knowledge of that system generally proceed thither for the purpose
of studying it.</p>

<p>The Druids do not go to war, nor pay tribute together with
the rest; they have an exemption from military service and a
dispensation in all matters. Induced by such great advantages,
many embrace this profession of their own accord, and many
are sent to it by their parents and relations. They are said
there to learn by heart a great number of verses; accordingly
some remain in the course of training twenty years. Nor do
they regard it lawful to commit these to writing, though in
almost all other matters, in their public and private transactions,
they use Greek characters. That practice they seem to me to
have adopted for two reasons: because they neither desire their
doctrines to be divulged among the mass of the people, nor
those who learn, to devote themselves the less to the efforts of
memory, relying on writing; since it generally occurs to most
men that in their dependence on writing they relax their diligence
in learning thoroughly, and their employment of the
memory. They wish to inculcate this as one of their leading
tenets: that souls do not become extinct, but pass after death
from one body to another; and they think that men by this
tenet are in a great degree excited to valor, the fear of death
being disregarded. They likewise discuss and impart to the
youth many things respecting the stars and their motion; respecting
the extent of the world and of our earth; respecting the
nature of things; respecting the power and the majesty of the
immortal gods.</p>

<p>The other order is that of the knights. These, when there
is occasion and any war occurs (which before CÃ¦sar's arrival was
for the most part wont to happen every year, as either they on
their part were inflicting injuries or repelling those which others
inflicted on them), are all engaged in war. And those of them
most distinguished by birth and resources have the greatest<span class="pagenum"><a id="page3060" name="page3060">3060</a></span>
number of vassals and dependants about them. They acknowledge
this sort of influence and power only.</p>

<p>The nation of all the Gauls is extremely devoted to superstitious
rites; and on that account they who are troubled with
unusually severe diseases, and they who are engaged in battles
and dangers, either sacrifice men as victims, or vow that
they will sacrifice them, and employ the Druids as the performers
of those sacrifices; because they think that unless the
life of a man be offered for the life of a man, the mind of the
immortal gods cannot be rendered propitious, and they have sacrifices
of that kind ordained for national purposes. Others have
figures of vast size, the limbs of which formed of osiers they fill
with living men, which being set on fire, the men perish enveloped
in the flames. They consider that the oblation of such as
have been taken in theft, or in robbery, or any other offense, is
more acceptable to the immortal gods; but when a supply of
that class is wanting, they have recourse to the oblation of even
the innocent.</p>

<p>They worship as their divinity Mercury in particular, and
have many images of him, and regard him as the inventor of all
arts; they consider him the guide of their journeys and marches,
and believe him to have very great influence over the acquisition
of gain and mercantile transactions. Next to him they worship
Apollo, and Mars, and Jupiter, and Minerva; respecting these
deities they have for the most part the same belief as other
nations: that Apollo averts diseases, that Minerva imparts the
invention of manufactures, that Jupiter possesses the sovereignty
of the heavenly powers; that Mars presides over wars. To him,
when they have determined to engage in battle, they commonly
vow those things which they shall take in war. When they have
conquered, they sacrifice whatever captured animals may have
survived the conflict, and collect the other things into one place.
In many States you may see piles of these things heaped up in
their consecrated spots; nor does it often happen that any one,
disregarding the sanctity of the case, dares either to secrete in his
house things captured, or take away those deposited; and the most
severe punishment, with torture, has been established for such a
deed.</p>

<p>All the Gauls assert that they are descended from the god
Dis, and say that this tradition has been handed down by the
Druids. For that reason they compute the divisions of every<span class="pagenum"><a id="page3061" name="page3061">3061</a></span>
season, not by the number of days, but of nights; they keep
birthdays and the beginnings of months and years in such an
order that the day follows the night. Among the other usages
of their life, they differ in this from almost all other nations;
that they do not permit their children to approach them openly
until they are grown up so as to be able to bear the service of
war; and they regard it as indecorous for a son of boyish age to
stand in public in the presence of his father.</p>

<p>Whatever sums of money the husbands have received in the
name of dowry from their wives, making an estimate of it, they
add the same amount out of their own estates. An account is kept
of all this money conjointly, and the profits are laid by; whichever
of them shall have survived the other, to that one the portion
of both reverts, together with the profits of the previous time.
Husbands have power of life and death over their wives as well
as over their children: and when the father of a family born in
a more than commonly distinguished rank has died, his relations
assemble, and if the circumstances of his death are suspicious,
hold an investigation upon the wives in the manner adopted
towards slaves; and if proof be obtained, put them to severe
torture and kill them. Their funerals, considering the state of
civilization among the Gauls, are magnificent and costly; and
they cast into the fire all things, including living creatures, which
they suppose to have been dear to them when alive; and a little
before this period, slaves and dependants who were ascertained
to have been beloved by them were, after the regular funeral
rites were completed, burnt together with them.</p>

<p>Those States which are considered to conduct their commonwealth
more judiciously have it ordained by their laws, that if
any person shall have heard by rumor and report from his
neighbors anything concerning the commonwealth, he shall convey
it to the magistrate and not impart it to any other; because
it has been discovered that inconsiderate and inexperienced men
were often alarmed by false reports and driven to some rash act,
or else took hasty measures in affairs of the highest importance.
The magistrates conceal those things which require to be kept
unknown; and they disclose to the people whatever they determine
to be expedient. It is not lawful to speak of the commonwealth
except in council.</p>

<p>The Germans differ much from these usages, for they have
neither Druids to preside over sacred offices nor do they pay<span class="pagenum"><a id="page3062" name="page3062">3062</a></span>
great regard to sacrifices. They rank in the number of the gods
those alone whom they behold, and by whose instrumentality
they are obviously benefited,&mdash;namely, the sun, fire, and the
moon; they have not heard of the other deities even by report.
Their whole life is occupied in hunting and in the pursuits of
the military art; from childhood they devote themselves to
fatigue and hardships. Those who have remained chaste for the
longest time receive the greatest commendation among their
people; they think that by this the growth is promoted, by this
the physical powers are increased and the sinews are strengthened.
And to have had knowledge of a woman before the
twentieth year they reckon among the most disgraceful acts; of
which matter there is no concealment, because they bathe promiscuously
in the rivers and only use skins or small cloaks of
deer's hides, a large portion of the body being in consequence
naked.</p>

<p>They do not pay much attention to agriculture, and a large
portion of their food consists in milk, cheese, and flesh; nor has
any one a fixed quantity of land or his own individual limits;
but the magistrates and the leading men each year apportion to
the tribes and families who have united together, as much land
as, and in the place in which, they think proper, and the year
after compel them to remove elsewhere. For this enactment
they advance many reasons&mdash;lest seduced by long-continued custom,
they may exchange their ardor in the waging of war for
agriculture; lest they may be anxious to acquire extensive estates,
and the more powerful drive the weaker from their possessions;
lest they construct their houses with too great a desire to
avoid cold and heat; lest the desire of wealth spring up, from
which cause divisions and discords arise; and that they may
keep the common people in a contented state of mind, when
each sees his own means placed on an equality with [those of]
the most powerful.</p>

<p>It is the greatest glory to the several States to have as wide
deserts as possible around them, their frontiers having been laid
waste. They consider this the real evidence of their prowess,
that their neighbors shall be driven out of their lands and abandon
them, and that no one dare settle near them; at the same
time they think that they shall be on that account the more
secure, because they have removed the apprehension of a sudden
incursion. When a State either repels war waged against it or<span class="pagenum"><a id="page3063" name="page3063">3063</a></span>
wages it against another, magistrates are chosen to preside over
that war with such authority that they have power of life and
death. In peace there is no common magistrate, but the chiefs
of provinces and cantons administer justice and determine controversies
among their own people. Robberies which are committed
beyond the boundaries of each State bear no infamy, and
they avow that these are committed for the purpose of disciplining
their youth and of preventing sloth. And when any of their
chiefs has said in an assembly that "he will be their leader; let
those who are willing to follow, give in their names," they who
approve of both the enterprise and the man arise and promise
their assistance and are applauded by the people; such of them
as have not followed him are accounted in the number of deserters
and traitors, and confidence in all matters is afterwards
refused them.</p>

<p>To injure guests they regard as impious; they defend from
wrong those who have come to them for any purpose whatever,
and esteem them inviolable; to them the houses of all are open
and maintenance is freely supplied.</p>

<p>And there was formerly a time when the Gauls excelled the
Germans in prowess, and waged war on them offensively, and
on account of the great number of their people and the insufficiency
of their land, sent colonies over the Rhine. Accordingly,
the VolcÃ¦ Tectos&#259;ges seized on those parts of Germany which
are the most fruitful and lie around the Hercynian forest
(which I perceive was known by report to Eratosthenes and
some other Greeks, and which they call Orcynia), and settled
there. Which nation to this time retains its position in those
settlements, and has a very high character for justice and military
merit: now also they continue in the same scarcity, indigence,
hardihood, as the Germans, and use the same food and
dress; but their proximity to the Province and knowledge of
commodities from countries beyond the sea supplies to the Gauls
many things tending to luxury as well as civilization. Accustomed
by degrees to be overmatched and worsted in many
engagements, they do not even compare themselves to the Germans
in prowess.</p>

<p>The breadth of this Hercynian forest which has been referred
to above is, to a quick traveler, a journey of nine days. For it
cannot be otherwise computed, nor are they acquainted with the
measures of roads. It begins at the frontiers of the Helvetii,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page3064" name="page3064">3064</a></span>
Nemetes, and Rauraci, and extends in a right line along the
river Danube to the territories of the Daci and the Anartes; it
bends thence to the left in a different direction from the river,
and owing to its extent, touches the confines of many nations;
nor is there any person belonging to this part of Germany who
says that he either has gone to the extremity of that forest,
though he had advanced a journey of sixty days, or has heard in
what place it begins. It is certain that many kinds of wild
beast are produced in it which have not been seen in other
parts; of which the following are such as differ principally from
other animals and appear worthy of being committed to record.</p>

<p>There is an ox of the shape of a stag, between whose ears a
horn rises from the middle of the forehead, higher and straighter
than those horns which are known to us. From the top of this,
branches, like palms, stretch out a considerable distance. The
shape of the female and of the male is the same; the appearance
and the size of the horns is the same.</p>

<p>There are also animals which are called elks. The shape of
these, and the varied color of their skins, is much like roes, but
in size they surpass them a little and are destitute of horns, and
have legs without joints and ligatures; nor do they lie down for
the purpose of rest, nor if they have been thrown down by any
accident, can they raise or lift themselves up. Trees serve as
beds to them; they lean themselves against them, and thus
reclining only slightly, they take their rest; when the huntsmen
have discovered from the footsteps of these animals whither they
are accustomed to betake themselves, they either undermine all
the trees at the roots, or cut into them so far that the upper
part of the trees may appear to be left standing. When they
have leant upon them, according to their habit, they knock down
by their weight the unsupported trees, and fall down themselves
along with them.</p>

<p>There is a third kind, consisting of those animals which are
called uri. These are a little below the elephant in size, and of
the appearance, color, and shape of a bull. Their strength and
speed are extraordinary; they spare neither man nor wild beast
which they have espied. These the Germans take with much
pains in pits and kill them. The young men harden themselves
with this exercise, and practice themselves in this kind of hunting,
and those who have slain the greatest number of them,
having produced the horns in public to serve as evidence,<span class="pagenum"><a id="page3065" name="page3065">3065</a></span>
receive great praise. But not even when taken very young can
they be rendered familiar to men and tamed. The size, shape,
and appearance of their horns differ much from the horns of our
oxen. These they [the Gauls] anxiously seek after, and bind at
the tips with silver, and use as cups at their most sumptuous
entertainments.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_TWO_LIEUTENANTS" id="THE_TWO_LIEUTENANTS"></a>THE TWO LIEUTENANTS</h3>

<p class="subtitle">From 'The Gallic Wars'</p>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="dcap">In that</span> legion there were two very brave men, centurions, who
were now approaching the first ranks,&mdash;T. Pulfio and L.
Varenus. These used to have continual disputes between
them which of them should be preferred, and every year used to
contend for promotion with the utmost animosity. When the
fight was going on most vigorously before the fortifications,
Pulfio, one of them, says: "Why do you hesitate, Varenus? or
what better opportunity of signalizing your valor do you seek?
This very day shall decide our disputes." When he had uttered
these words, he proceeds beyond the fortifications, and rushes
on that part of the enemy which appeared the thickest. Nor
does Varenus remain within the rampart, but respecting the high
opinion of all, follows close after. Then, when an inconsiderable
space intervened, Pulfio throws his javelin at the enemy, and
pierces one of the multitude who was running up, and while the
latter was wounded and slain, the enemy cover him with their
shields, and all throw their weapons at the other and afford him
no opportunity of retreating. The shield of Pulfio is pierced
and a javelin is fastened in his belt. This circumstance turns
aside his scabbard and obstructs his right hand when attempting
to draw his sword: the enemy crowd around him when thus
embarrassed. His rival runs up to him and succors him in this
emergency. Immediately the whole host turn from Pulfio to him,
supposing the other to be pierced through by the javelin. Varenus
rushes on briskly with his sword and carries on the combat
hand to hand; and having slain one man, for a short time drove
back the rest: while he urges on too eagerly, slipping into a
hollow, he fell. To him in his turn, when surrounded, Pulfio
brings relief; and both, having slain a great number, retreat into
the fortifications amidst the highest applause. Fortune so dealt<span class="pagenum"><a id="page3066" name="page3066">3066</a></span>
with both in this rivalry and conflict, that the one competitor
was a succor and a safeguard to the other; nor could it be determined
which of the two appeared worthy of being preferred to
the other.</p>

<p class="subtitle">(1853-)</p>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/cap_t.png" title="" alt="T" width="73" height="73" class="cap" />
<p class="cap_1"><span class="dcap">Thomas</span> Henry Hall Caine was born on the Isle of Man, of
Manx and Cambrian parentage. He began his career as an
architect in Liverpool, and made frequent contributions to
the Builder and Building News. Acquiring a taste for literary work,
he secured an engagement on the Liverpool Mercury, and shortly
afterward formed an intimate friendship with Dante Gabriel Rossetti
which was of incalculable benefit to the young writer, then twenty-five
years of age. At eighteen he had already published a poem "of
the mystical sort" under a pseudonym, and
two years later he received Â£10 for writing
the autobiography of some one else.</p></div>

<img src="images/illus-0349-2.png" width="163" height="200" alt="" title="" />
<p class="caption smcap">Hall Caine</p>
</div>

<p>About 1880 Caine settled in London, living
with Rossetti until the poet's death in
1882. The same year he produced 'Recollections
of Rossetti' and 'Sonnets of Three
Centuries,' which were followed by 'Cobwebs
of Criticism' and a 'Life of Coleridge.'
In 1885 he published his first novel, 'The
Shadow of a Crime,' which was successful.
Speaking of the pains he took in the writing
of this story, the author says: "Shall I
ever forget the agonies of the first efforts?...
It took me nearly a fortnight to
start that novel, sweating drops as of blood at every fresh attempt."
The first half was written at least four times; and when the book
was finished, more than half of it was destroyed so that a fresh suggestion
might be worked in. This wonderful capacity for taking
infinite pains has remained one of the chief characteristics of this
novelist. In 1886 Mr. Caine brought out 'A Son of Hagar,' and this
was followed by 'The Deemster' (1887), afterwards dramatized under
the title of 'Ben-Ma'-Chree'; 'The Bondman' (1890); 'The Scapegoat'
(1891); 'The Last Confession,' 'Cap'n Davy's Honeymoon' (1892);
and 'The Manxman' (1894). The last story has achieved the widest
popularity, its theme being the unselfishness of a great love. He has
also written a history of his native island.</p>

<p>Mr. Caine visited Russia in 1892 in behalf of the persecuted Jews,
and in 1895 traveled in the United States and Canada, where he<span class="pagenum"><a id="page3068" name="page3068">3068</a></span>
represented the Society of Authors, and obtained important international
copyright concessions from the Dominion Parliament. He
makes his principal home at Greeba Castle on the Isle of Man, where
he is greatly endeared to the natives.</p>

<p class="subtitle">From 'The Manxman': copyrighted 1894, by D. Appleton and Company</p>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="dcap">Pete</span> went up to Sulby like an avalanche, shouting his greetings
to everybody on the way. But when he got near to
the "Fairy" he wiped his steaming forehead and held his
panting breath, and pretended not to have heard the news.</p>

<p>"How's the poor girl now?" he said in a meek voice, trying
to look powerfully miserable, and playing his part splendidly for
thirty seconds.</p>

<p>Then the women made eyes at each other and looked wondrous
knowing, and nodded sideways at Pete, and clucked and
chuckled, saying, "Look at him,&mdash;<i>he</i> doesn't know anything, does
he?"&mdash;"Coorse not, woman&mdash;these men creatures are no use for
nothing."</p>

<p>"Out of a man's way," cried Pete with a roar, and he made
a rush for the stairs.</p>

<p>Nancy blocked him at the foot of them with both hands on
his shoulders. "You'll be quiet, then," she whispered. "You
were always a rasonable man, Pete, and she's wonderful wake&mdash;promise
you'll be quiet."</p>

<p>"I'll be like a mouse," said Pete, and he wiped off his long
sea-boots and crept on tiptoe into the room. There she lay with
the morning light on her, and a face as white as the quilt that
she was plucking with her long fingers.</p>

<p>"Thank God for a living mother and a living child," said
Pete in a broken gurgle, and then he drew down the bedclothes
a very little, and there too was the child on the pillow of her
other arm.</p>

<p>Then, do what he would to be quiet, he could not help but
make a shout.</p>

<p>"He's there! Yes, he is! He is, though! Joy! Joy!"</p>

<p>The women were down on him like a flock of geese. "Out
of this, sir, if you can't behave better."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page3069" name="page3069">3069</a></span>
"Excuse me, ladies," said Pete humbly, "I'm not in the
habit of babies. A bit excited, you see, Mistress Nancy, ma'am.
Couldn't help putting a bull of a roar out, not being used of the
like." Then, turning back to the bed, "Aw, Kitty, the beauty it
is, though! And the big! As big as my fist already. And the
fat! It's as fat as a bluebottle. And the straight! Well, not so
<i>very</i> straight neither, but the complexion at him now! Give him
to me, Kitty! give him to me, the young rascal. Let me have a
hould of him anyway."</p>

<p>"<i>Him</i>, indeed! Listen to the man," said Nancy.</p>

<p>"It's a girl, Pete," said Grannie, lifting the child out of the
bed.</p>

<p>"A girl, is it?" said Pete doubtfully. "Well," he said, with
a wag of the head, "thank God for a girl." Then, with another
and more resolute wag, "Yes, thank God for a living mother and
a living child, if it <i>is</i> a girl," and he stretched out his arms to
take the baby.</p>

<p>"Aisy, now, Pete&mdash;aisy," said Grannie, holding it out to him.</p>

<p>"Is it aisy broke they are, Grannie?" said Pete. A good
spirit looked out of his great boyish face. "Come to your ould
daddie, you lil sandpiper. Gough bless me, Kitty, the weight
of him, though! This child's a quarter of a hundred, if he's an
ounce. He is, I'll go bail he is. Look at him! Guy heng,
Grannie, did ye ever see the like, now! It's abs'lute perfection.
Kitty, I couldn't have had a better one if I'd chiced it. Where's
that Tom Hommy now? The bleating little billygoat, he was
bragging outrageous about his new baby&mdash;saying he wouldn't
part with it for two of the best cows in his cow-house. This'll
floor him, I'm thinking. What's that you're saying, Mistress
Nancy, ma'am? No good for nothing, am I? You were right,
Grannie. 'It'll be all joy soon,' you were saying, and haven't
we the child to show for it? I put on my stocking inside out on
Monday, ma'am. 'I'm in luck,' says I, and so I was. Look at
that, now! He's shaking his lil fist at his father. He is, though.
This child knows me. Aw, you're clever, Nancy, but&mdash;no nonsense
at all, Mistress Nancy, ma'am. Nothing will persuade me
but this child knows me."</p>

<p>"Do you hear the man?" said Nancy. "<i>He</i> and <i>he</i>, and <i>he</i>
and <i>he</i>! It's a girl, I'm telling you; a girl&mdash;a girl&mdash;a girl."</p>

<p>"Well, well, a girl, then&mdash;a girl we'll make it," said Pete,
with determined resignation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page3070" name="page3070">3070</a></span>
"He's deceaved," said Grannie. "It was a boy he was wanting,
poor fellow!"</p>

<p>But Pete scoffed at the idea. "A boy? Never! No, no&mdash;a
girl for your life. I'm all for girls myself, eh, Kitty? Always
was, and now I've got two of them."</p>

<p>The child began to cry, and Grannie took it back and rocked
it, face downwards, across her knees.</p>

<p>"Goodness me, the voice at him!" said Pete. "It's a skipper
he's born for&mdash;a harbor-master, anyway."</p>

<p>The child slept, and Grannie put it on the pillow turned
lengthwise at Kate's side.</p>

<p>"Quiet as a Jenny Wren, now," said Pete. "Look at the
bogh smiling in his sleep. Just like a baby mermaid on the
egg of a dogfish. But where's the ould man at all? Has he
seen it? We must have it in the papers. The Times? Yes,
and the 'Tiser too. 'The beloved wife of Mr. Capt'n Peter
Quilliam, of a boy&mdash;a girl,' I mane. Aw, the wonder there'll
be all the island over&mdash;everybody getting to know. Newspapers
are like women&mdash;ter'ble bad for keeping sacrets. What'll Philip
say?"...</p>

<p>There was a low moaning from the bed.</p>

<p>"Air! Give me air! open the door!" Kate gasped.</p>

<p>"The room is getting too hot for her," said Grannie.</p>

<p>"Come, there's one too many of us here," said Nancy. "Out
of it," and she swept Pete from the bedroom with her apron as
if he had been a drove of ducks.</p>

<p>Pete glanced backward from the door, and a cloak that was
hanging on the inside of it brushed his face.</p>

<p>"God bless her!" he said in a low tone. "God bless and
reward her for going through this for me!"</p>

<p>Then he touched the cloak with his lips and disappeared. A
moment later his curly black poll came stealing round the door-jamb,
half-way down, like the head of a big boy.</p>

<p>"Nancy," in a whisper, "put the tongs over the cradle; it's
a pity to tempt the fairies. And, Grannie, I wouldn't lave it
alone to go out to the cow-house&mdash;the lil people are shocking
bad for changing."</p>

<h2><a name="PEDRO_CALDERON" id="PEDRO_CALDERON"></a>PEDRO CALDERON</h2>

<p class="subtitle">(1600-1681)</p>

<p class="subtitle">BY MAURICE FRANCIS EGAN</p>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/cap_t.png" title="" alt="T" width="73" height="73" class="cap" />
<p class="cap_1"><span class="dcap">The</span> reputation of Pedro Calderon de la Barca has suffered in
the minds of English-speaking people from the injudicious
comparisons of critics, as well as from lack of knowledge of
his works. To put Calderon, a master of invention, beside Shakespeare,
the master of character, and to show by analogies that the
author of 'Othello' was far superior to the writer of 'The Physician
of His Own Honor,' is unjust to Calderon; and it is as futile as are
the ecstasies of Schultze to the coldness of Sismondi. Schultze compares
Dante with him, and the French critics have only recently forgiven
him for being less classical in form than Corneille, who in
'Le Cid' gave them all the Spanish poetry they wanted! Fortunately
the student of Calderon need not take opinions. Good editions
of Calderon are easily attainable. The best known are Heil's (Leipzig,
1827), and that by Harzenbusch (Madrid, 1848). The first
edition, with forewords by Vera Tassis de Villareal, appeared at
Madrid (nine volumes) in 1682-91. Commentaries and translations are
numerous in German and in English; the translations by Denis
Florence MacCarthy are the most satisfactory, Edward Fitzgerald's
being too paraphrastic. Dean Trench added much to our knowledge
of Calderon's best work; George Ticknor in the 'History of Spanish
Literature,' and George Henry Lewes in 'The Spanish Drama,' left
us clear estimates of Lope de Vega's great successor. Shelley's
scenes from 'El <ins class="correction" title="Original was 'Magico'">MÃ¡gico</ins> Prodigioso' are superb.</p></div>

<p>No analyses can do justice to the dramas, or to the religious
plays, called "<i>autos</i>," of Calderon. They must be read; and thanks to
the late Mr. MacCarthy's sympathy and zeal, the finest are easily
attainable. As he left seventy-three <i>autos</i> and one hundred and
eight dramas, it is lucky that the work of sifting the best from the
mass of varying merit has been carefully done. Mr. Ticknor mentions
the fact that Calderon collaborated with other authors in the
writing of fourteen other plays.</p>

<p>Calderon was not "the Spanish Shakespeare." "The Spanish Ben
Jonson" would be a happier title, if one feels obliged to compare
everything with something else. But Calderon is as far above Ben
Jonson in splendor of imagery as he is below Shakespeare in his<span class="pagenum"><a id="page3072" name="page3072">3072</a></span>
knowledge of the heart, and in that vitality which makes Hamlet
and Orlando, Lady Macbeth and Perdita, men and women of all
time. They live; Calderon's people, like Ben Jonson's, move. There
is a resemblance between the <i>autos</i> of Calderon and the masques of
Jonson. Jonson's are lyrical; Calderon's less lyrical than splendid,
ethical, grandiose. They were both court poets; they both made
court spectacles; they both assisted in the decay of the drama; they
reflected the tastes of their time; but Calderon is the more noble,
the more splendid in imagination, the more intense in his devotion
to nature in all her moods. If one wanted to carry the habit of
comparison into music, Mozart might well represent the spirit of
Calderon. M. PhilarÃ¨te Chasles is right when he says that 'El
MÃ¡gico Prodigioso' should be presented in a cathedral. Calderon's
genius had the cast of the soldier and the priest, and he was both
soldier and priest. His <i>comedias</i> and <i>autos</i> are of Spain, Spanish. To
know Calderon is to know the mind of the Spain of the seventeenth
century; to know Cervantes is to know its heart.</p>

<p>The Church had opposed the secularization of the drama, at the
end of the fifteenth century, for two reasons. The dramatic spectacle
fostered for religious purposes had become, until Lope de Vega
rescued it, a medium for that "naturalism" which some of us fancy
to be a discovery of M. Zola and M. Catulle MendÃ¨s; it had escaped
from the control of the Church and had become a mere diversion.
Calderon was the one man who could unite the spirit of religion to
the form of the drama which the secular renaissance imperiously
demanded. He knew the philosophy of Aristotle and the theology of
the 'Summa' of St. Thomas as well as any cleric in Spain, though
he did not take orders until late in life; and in those religious spectacles
called <i>autos sacramentales</i> he showed this knowledge wonderfully.
His last <i>auto</i> was unfinished when he died, on May 25th, 1681,&mdash;sixty-five
years after the death of Shakespeare,&mdash;and Don Melchior
de Leon completed it, probably in time for the feast of Corpus
Christi.</p>

<p>The <i>auto</i> was an elaboration of the older miracle-play, and a spectacle
as much in keeping with the temper of the Spanish court and
people as Shakespeare's 'Midsummer Night's Dream' or Ben Jonson's
'Fortunate Isles' was in accord with the tastes of the English. And
Calderon, of all Spanish poets, best pleased his people. He was the
favorite poet of the court under Philip IV., and director of the theatre
in the palace of the Buen Retiro. The skill in the art of construction
which he had begun to acquire when he wrote 'The
Devotion of the Cross' at the age of nineteen, was turned to stage
management at the age of thirty-five, when he produced his gorgeous
pageant of 'Circe' on the pond of the Buen Retiro. How elaborate<span class="pagenum"><a id="page3073" name="page3073">3073</a></span>
this spectacle was, the directions for the prelude of the greater
splendor to come will show. They read in this way:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"In the midst of this island will be situated a very lofty mountain of
rugged ascent, with precipices and caverns, surrounded by a thick and darksome
wood of tall trees, some of which will be seen to exhibit the appearance
of the human form, covered with a rough bark, from the heads and arms of
which will issue green boughs and branches, having suspended from them
various trophies of war and of the chase: the theatre during the opening of
the scene being scantily lit with concealed lights; and to make a beginning
of the festival, a murmuring and a rippling noise of water having been heard,
a great and magnificent car will be seen to advance along the pond, plated
over with silver, and drawn by two monstrous fishes, from whose mouth will
continually issue great jets of water, the light of the theatre increasing according
as they advance; and on the summit of it will be seen seated in
great pomp and majesty the goddess Aqua, from whose head and curious
vesture will issue an infinite abundance of little conduits of water; and at the
same time will be seen another great supply flowing from an urn which the
goddess will hold reversed, and which, filled with a variety of fishes leaping
and playing in the torrent as it descends and gliding over all the car, will
fall into the pond."</p></blockquote>

<p>This 'Circe' was allegorical and mythological; it was one of
those soulless shows which marked the transition of the Spanish
drama from maturity to decay. It is gone and forgotten with thousands
of its kind. Calderon will be remembered not as the director
of such vain pomps, but as the author of the sublime and tender
'Wonderful Magician,' the weird 'Purgatory of St. Patrick,' 'The
Constant Prince,' 'The Secret in Words,' and 'The Physician of His
Own Honor.' The scrupulous student of the Spanish drama will
demand more; but for him who would love Calderon without making
a deep study of his works, these are sufficiently characteristic of his
genius at its highest. The reader in search of wider vistas should
add to these 'Los Encantos de la Culpa' (The Sorceries of Sin), and
'The Great Theatre of the World,' the theme of which is that of
Jacques's famous speech in 'As You Like It':&mdash;</p>

<span class="i0">Todos son representados."<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>On the principal feasts of the Church <i>autos</i> were played in the
streets, generally in front of some great house. Giants and grotesque
figures called <i>tarascas</i> gamboled about; and the <i>auto</i>, which was more
like our operas than any other composition of the Spanish stage, was
begun by a <i>loa</i>, written or sung. After this came the play, then an<span class="pagenum"><a id="page3074" name="page3074">3074</a></span>
amusing interlude, followed by music and sometimes by a dance of
gipsies.</p>

<p>Calderon boldly mingles pagan gods and Christ's mysteries in
these <i>autos</i>, which are essentially of his time and his people. But the
mixture is not so shocking as it is with the lesser poet, the Portuguese
Camoens. Whether Calderon depicts 'The True God Pan,'
'Love the Greatest Enchantment,' or 'The Sheaves of Ruth,' he is
forceful, dramatic, and even at times he has the awful gravity of
Dante. His view of life and his philosophy are the view of life and
the philosophy of Dante. To many of us, these simple and original
productions of the Spanish temperament and genius may lack what
we call "human interest." Let us remember that they represented
truthfully the faith and the hope, the spiritual knowledge of a
nation, as well as the personal and national view of that knowledge.
In the Spain of Calderon, the personal view was the national view.</p>

<p>Calderon was born on January 17th, 1600,&mdash;according to his own
statement quoted by his friend Vera Tassis,&mdash;at Madrid, of noble
parents. He was partly educated at the University of Salamanca.
Like Cervantes and Garcilaso, he served in the army. The great
Lope, in 1630, acknowledged him as a poet and his friend. Later,
his transition from the army to the priesthood made little change in
his views of time and eternity.</p>

<p>On May 25th, 1881, occurred the second centenary of his death,
and the civilized world&mdash;whose theatre owes more to Calderon than
it has ever acknowledged&mdash;celebrated with Spain the anniversary
at Madrid, where as he said,&mdash;</p>

<p>The selections have been chosen from Shelley's 'Scenes,' and
from Mr. MacCarthy's translation of 'The Secret in Words.' 'The
Secret in Words' is light comedy of intricate plot. Fabio is an
example of the attendant <i>gracioso</i>, half servant, half confidant, who
appears often in the Spanish drama. The Spanish playwright did
not confine himself to one form of verse; and Mr. MacCarthy, in his
adequate translation, has followed the various forms of Calderon,
only not attempting the assonant vowel, so hard to escape in
Spanish, and still harder to reproduce in English. These selections
give no impression of the amazing invention of Calderon. This can
only be appreciated through reading 'The Constant Prince,' 'The
Physician of His Own Honor,' or a comedy like 'The Secret in
Words.'</p>

<h3><a name="DREAMS_AND_REALITIES" id="DREAMS_AND_REALITIES"></a>DREAMS AND REALITIES</h3>

<p>From 'Such Stuff as Dreams are Made Of,' Edward Fitzgerald's version of
'La Vida Es Sueno'</p>

<p>[The scene is a tower. Clotaldo is persuading Segismund that his experiences
have not been real, but dreams, and discusses the possible relation of
existence to a state of dreaming. The play itself is based on the familiar
<i>motif</i> of which Christopher Sly furnishes a ready example.]</p>

<h2><a name="JOHN_CALDWELL_CALHOUN" id="JOHN_CALDWELL_CALHOUN"></a>JOHN CALDWELL CALHOUN</h2>

<p class="subtitle">(1782-1850)</p>

<p class="subtitle">BY W. P. TRENT</p>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/cap_j.png" title="" alt="J" width="73" height="75" class="cap" />
<p class="cap_2"><span class="dcap">John C. Calhoun's</span> importance as a statesman has naturally
stood in the way of his recognition as a writer, and in like
manner his reputation as an orator has overshadowed his
just claims to be considered our most original political thinker. The
six volumes of his collected works, which unfortunately do not embrace
his still inaccessible private correspondence, are certainly not
exhilarating or attractive reading; but they are unique in the literature
of America, if not of the world, as models of passionless logical
analysis. Whether passionless logical analysis is ever an essential
quality of true literature, is a matter on which opinions will differ;
but until the question is settled in the negative, Calhoun's claims to
be considered a writer of marked force and originality cannot be
ignored. It is true that circumstances have invalidated much of his
political teaching, and that it was always negative and destructive
rather than positive and constructive; it is true also that much of
the interest attaching to his works is historical rather than literary
in character: but when all allowances are made, it will be found that
the 'Disquisition on Government' must still be regarded as the most
remarkable political treatise our country has produced, and that the
position of its author as the head of a school of political thought is
commanding, and in a way unassailable.</p></div>

<p>The precise character of Calhoun's political philosophy, the keynote
of which was the necessity and means of defending the rights
of minorities, cannot be understood without a brief glance at his
political career. His birth in 1782 just after the Revolution, and in
South Carolina, gave him the opportunity to share in the victory
that the West and the far South won over the Virginians, headed by
Madison. His training at Yale gave a nationalistic bias to his early
career, and determined that search for the <i>via media</i> between consolidation
and anarchy which resulted in the doctrine of nullification.
His service in Congress and as Secretary of War under Monroe gave
him a practical training in affairs that was not without influence in
qualifying his tendency to indulge in doctrinaire speculation. His
service as Vice-President afforded the leisure and his break with
Jackson the occasion, for his close study of the Constitution, to discover
how the South might preserve slavery and yet continue in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page3088" name="page3088">3088</a></span>
Union. Finally, his position as a non-aristocratic leader of a body
of aristocrats, and his Scotch-Irish birth and training, gave a peculiar
strenuousness to his support of slavery, which is of course the
corner-stone of his political philosophy; and determined his reliance
upon logic rather than upon an appeal to the passions as the best
means of inculcating his teaching and of establishing his policy. His
political treatises, 'A Discourse on Government' and 'On the Constitution
and Government of the United States,' written just before his
death in 1850; his pamphlets like the 'South Carolina Exposition'
and the 'Address to the People of South Carolina'; and the great
speeches delivered in the Senate from 1832 to the end of his term,
especially those in which he defended against Webster the doctrine
of nullification, could have emanated only from an up-country South-Carolinian
who had inherited the mantle of Jefferson, and had sat at
the feet of John Taylor of Carolina and of John Randolph of Roanoke.
Calhoun was, then, the logical outcome of his environment and
his training; he was the fearless and honest representative of his
people and section; and he was the master from whom rash disciples
like Jefferson Davis broke away, when they found that logical analysis
of the Constitution was a poor prop for slavery against the rising
tide of civilization.</p>

<p>As a thinker Calhoun is remarkable for great powers of analysis
and exposition. As a writer he is chiefly noted for the even dignity
and general serviceableness of his style. He writes well, but rather
like a logician than like an inspired orator. He has not the stateliness
of Webster, and is devoid of the power of arousing enthusiasm.
The splendor of Burke's imagination is utterly beyond him, as is
also the epigrammatic brilliance of John Randolph,&mdash;from whom,
however, he took not a few lessons in constitutional interpretation.
Indeed, it must be confessed that for all his clearness and subtlety
of intellect as a thinker, Calhoun is as a writer distinctly heavy.
In this as in many other respects he reminds us of the Romans, to
whom he was continually referring. Like them he is conspicuous
for strength of practical intellect; like them he is lacking in sublimity,
charm, and nobility. It follows then that Calhoun will rarely
be resorted to as a model of eloquence, but that he will continue to
be read both on account of the substantial additions he made to
political philosophy, and of the interesting exposition he gave of
theories and ideas once potent in the nation's history.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the bitterness of accusation brought against him,
he was not a traitor nor a man given over to selfish ambition, as
Dr. von Holst, his most competent biographer and critic, has clearly
shown. Calhoun believed both in slavery and in the Union, and
tried to maintain a balance between the two, because he thought<span class="pagenum"><a id="page3089" name="page3089">3089</a></span>
that only in this way could his section maintain its prestige or even
its existence. He failed, as any other man would have done; and
we find him, like Cassandra, a prophet whom we cannot love. But
he did prophesy truly as to the fate of the South; and in the course
of his strenuous labors to divert the ruin he saw impending, he gave
to the world the most masterly analysis of the rights of the minority
and of the best methods of securing them that has yet come from
the pen of a publicist.</p>

<h3><a name="REMARKS_ON_THE_RIGHT_OF_PETITION" id="REMARKS_ON_THE_RIGHT_OF_PETITION"></a>REMARKS ON THE RIGHT OF PETITION</h3>

<p class="subtitle smcap">Delivered in the Senate, February 13th, 1840</p>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="dcap">Mr. Calhoun</span> said he rose to express the pleasure he felt at
the evidence which the remarks of the Senator from
Kentucky furnished, of the progress of truth on the subject
of abolition. He had spoken with strong approbation of the
principle laid down in a recent pamphlet, that two races of different
character and origin could not coexist in the same country
without the subordination of the one to the other. He was
gratified to hear the Senator give assent to so important a principle
in application to the condition of the South. He had
himself, several years since, stated the same in more specific
terms: that it was impossible for two races, so dissimilar in
every respect as the European and African that inhabit the
southern portion of this Union, to exist together in nearly equal
numbers in any other relation than that which existed there.
He also added that experience had shown that they could so
exist in peace and happiness there, certainly to the great benefit
of the inferior race; and that to destroy it was to doom the
latter to destruction. But he uttered these important truths
then in vain, as far as the side to which the Senator belongs is
concerned.</p>

<p>He trusted the progress of truth would not, however, stop at
the point to which it has arrived with the Senator, and that it
will make some progress in regard to what is called the right of
petition. Never was a right so much mystified and magnified.
To listen to the discussion, here and elsewhere, you would suppose
it to be the most essential and important right: so far<span class="pagenum"><a id="page3090" name="page3090">3090</a></span>
from it, he undertook to aver that under our free and popular
system it was among the least of all our political rights. It
had been superseded in a great degree by the far higher right
of general suffrage, and by the practice, now so common, of
instruction. There could be no local grievance but what could
be reached by these, except it might be the grievance affecting
a minority, which could be no more redressed by petition than
by them. The truth is, that the right of petition could scarcely
be said to be the right <i>of a freeman</i>. It belongs to despotic
governments more properly, and might be said to be the last
right of slaves. Who ever heard of petition in the free States
of antiquity? We had borrowed our notions in regard to it from
our British ancestors, with whom it had a value for their imperfect
representation far greater than it has with us; and it is
owing to that that it has a place at all in our Constitution. The
truth is, that the right has been so far superseded in a political
point of view, that it has ceased to be what the Constitution
contemplated it to be,&mdash;a shield to protect against wrongs; and
has been perverted into a sword to attack the rights of others&mdash;to
cause a grievance instead of the means of redressing grievances,
as in the case of abolition petitions. The Senator from
Ohio [Mr. Tappan] has viewed this subject in its proper light,
and has taken a truly patriotic and constitutional stand in refusing
to present these firebrands, for which I heartily thank him
in the name of my State. Had the Senator from Kentucky followed
the example, he would have rendered inestimable service
to the country....</p>

<p>It is useless to attempt concealment. The presentation of
these incendiary petitions is itself an infraction of the Constitution.
All acknowledge&mdash;the Senator himself&mdash;that the property
which they are presented to destroy is guaranteed by the
Constitution. Now I ask: If we have the right under the Constitution
to hold the property (which none question), have we
not also the right to hold it under the same sacred instrument
<i>in peace and quiet</i>? Is it not a direct infraction then of the
Constitution, to present petitions here in the common council of
the Union, and to us, the agents appointed to carry its provisions
into effect and to guard the rights it secures, the
professed aim of which is to destroy the property guaranteed by
the instrument? There can be but one answer to these questions
on the part of those who present such petitions: that the right<span class="pagenum"><a id="page3091" name="page3091">3091</a></span>
of such petition is higher and more sacred than the Constitution
and our oaths to preserve and to defend it. To such monstrous
results does the doctrine lead.</p>

<p>Sir, I understand this whole question. The great mass of
both parties to the North are opposed to abolition: the Democrats
almost exclusively; the Whigs less so. Very few are to
be found in the ranks of the former; but many in those of the
latter. The only importance that the abolitionists have is to be
found in the fact that their weight may be felt in elections; and
this is no small advantage. The one party is unwilling to lose
their weight, but at the same time unwilling to be blended with
them on the main question; and hence is made this false,
absurd, unconstitutional, and dangerous collateral issue on the
right of petition. Here is the whole secret. They are willing
to play the political game at our hazard, and that of the Constitution
and the Union, for the sake of victory at the elections.
But to show still more clearly how little foundation there is in
the character of our government for the extravagant importance
attached to this right, I ask the Senator what is the true
relation between the government and the people, according to
our American conception? Which is principal and which agent?
which the master and which the servant? which the sovereign
and which the subject? There can be no answer. We are but
the agents&mdash;the servants. We are not the sovereign. The
sovereignty resides in the people of the States. How little
applicable, then, is this boasted right of petition, under our
system, to political questions? Who ever heard of the principal
petitioning his agent&mdash;of the master, his servant&mdash;or of the
sovereign, his subject? <i>The very essence of a petition implies a
request from an inferior to a superior.</i> It is not in fact a natural
growth of our system. It was copied from the British Bill of
Rights, and grew up among a people whose representation was
very imperfect, and where the sovereignty of the people was not
recognized at all. And yet even there, this right so much
insisted on here as being boundless as space, was restricted
from the beginning by the very men who adopted it in the
British system, in the very manner which has been done in the
other branch, this session; and to an extent far beyond. The
two Houses of Parliament have again and again passed resolutions
against receiving petitions even to repeal taxes; and this,
those who formed our Constitution well knew, and yet adopted<span class="pagenum"><a id="page3092" name="page3092">3092</a></span>
the provision almost identically contained in the British Bill of
Rights, without guarding against the practice under it. Is not
the conclusion irresistible, that they did not deem it inconsistent
with the right of "the citizens peaceably to assemble and petition
for a redress of grievance," as secured in the Constitution?
The thing is clear. It is time that the truth should be known,
and this cant about petition, not to redress the grievances of
the petitioners, but to create a grievance elsewhere, be put
down....</p>

<p>I know this question to the bottom. I have viewed it under
every possible aspect. There is no safety but in prompt, determined,
and uncompromising defense of our rights&mdash;to meet the
danger on the frontier. There all rights are strongest, and
more especially this. The moral is like the physical world.
Nature has incrusted the exterior of all organic life, for its
safety. Let that be broken through, and it is all weakness
within. So in the moral and political world. It is on the
extreme limits of right that all wrong and encroachments are
the most sensibly felt and easily resisted. I have acted on this
principle throughout in this great contest. I took my lessons
from the patriots of the Revolution. They met wrong promptly,
and defended right against the first encroachment. To sit here
and hear ourselves and constituents, and their rights and institutions
(essential to their safety), assailed from day to day&mdash;denounced
by every epithet calculated to degrade and render us
odious; and to meet all this in silence,&mdash;or still worse, to reason
with the foul slanderers,&mdash;would eventually destroy every feeling
of pride and dignity, and sink us in feelings to the condition of
the slaves they would emancipate. And this the Senator advises
us to do. Adopt it, and the two houses would be converted
into halls to debate our rights to our property, and whether, in
holding it, we were not thieves, robbers, and kidnappers; and
we are to submit to this in order to quiet the North! I tell the
Senator that our Union, and our high moral tone of feeling on
this subject at the South, are infinitely more important to us
than any possible effect that his course could have at the North;
and that if we could have the weakness to adopt his advice, it
would even fail to effect the object intended.</p>

<p>It is proper to speak out. If this question is left to itself,
unresisted by us, it cannot but terminate fatally to us. Our
safety and honor are in the opposite direction&mdash;to take the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page3093" name="page3093">3093</a></span>
highest ground, and maintain it resolutely. The North will
always take position below us, be ours high or low. They
will yield all that we will and something more. If we go for
rejection, they will at first insist on receiving, on the ground of
respect for petition. If we yield that point and receive petitions,
they will go for reference, on the ground that it is absurd
to receive and not to act&mdash;as it truly is. If we go for that,
they will insist on reporting and discussing; and if that, the
next step will be to make concession&mdash;to yield the point of
abolition in this District; and so on till the whole process is
consummated, each succeeding step proving more easy than its
predecessor. The reason is obvious. The abolitionists understand
their game. They throw their votes to the party most
disposed to favor them. Now, sir, in the hot contest of party
in the Northern section, on which the ascendency in their
several States and the general government may depend, all the
passions are roused to the greatest height in the violent struggle,
and aid sought in every quarter. They would forget us in
the heat of battle; yes, the success of the election, for the time,
would be more important than our safety; unless we by our
determined stand on our rights cause our weight to be felt, and
satisfy both parties that they have nothing to gain by courting
those who aim at our destruction. <i>As far as this government is
concerned, that is our only remedy.</i> If we yield that, if we lower
our stand to permit partisans to woo the aid of those who are
striking at our interests, we shall commence a descent in which
there is no stopping-place short of total abolition, and with it
our destruction.</p>

<p>A word in answer to the Senator from Massachusetts [Mr.
Webster]. He attempted to show that the right of petition was
peculiar to free governments. So far is the assertion from being
true, that it is more appropriately the right of despotic governments;
and the more so, the more absolute and austere. So far
from being peculiar or congenial to free popular States, it
degenerates under them, necessarily, into an instrument, not of
redress for the grievances of the petitioners, but as has been
remarked, of assault on the rights of others, as in this case.
That I am right in making the assertion, I put it to the Senator&mdash;Have
we not a right under the Constitution to our property in
our slaves? Would it not be a violation of the Constitution to
divest us of that right? Have we not a right to enjoy, <i>under<span class="pagenum"><a id="page3094" name="page3094">3094</a></span>
the Constitution, peaceably and quietly, our acknowledged rights
guaranteed by it</i>, without annoyance? The Senator assents. He
does but justice to his candor and intelligence. Now I ask him,
how can he assent to receive petitions whose object is to annoy
and disturb our right, and of course in direct infraction of the
Constitution?</p>

<p>The Senator from Ohio [Mr. Tappan], in refusing to present
these incendiary and unconstitutional petitions, has adopted a
course truly constitutional and patriotic, and in my opinion, the
only one that is so. I deeply regret that it has not been followed
by the Senator from Kentucky in the present instance.
Nothing short of it can put a stop to the mischief, and do justice
to one-half of the States of the Union. If adopted by
others, we shall soon hear no more of abolition. The responsibility
of keeping alive this agitation must rest on those who may
refuse to follow so noble an example.</p>

<h3><a name="STATE_RIGHTS" id="STATE_RIGHTS"></a>STATE RIGHTS</h3>

<p class="subtitle">From the 'Speech on the Admission of Michigan,' 1837</p>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="dcap">It has</span> perhaps been too much my habit to look more to the
future and less to the present than is wise; but such is the
constitution of my mind that when I see before me the indications
of causes calculated to effect important changes in our
political condition, I am led irresistibly to trace them to their
sources and follow them out in their consequences. Language
has been held in this discussion which is clearly revolutionary in
its character and tendency, and which warns us of the approach of
the period when the struggle will be between the <i>conservatives</i> and
the <i>destructives</i>. I understood the Senator from Pennsylvania
[Mr. Buchanan] as holding language countenancing the principle
that the will of a mere numerical majority is paramount to the
authority of law and constitution. He did not indeed announce
distinctly this principle, but it might fairly be inferred from
what he said; for he told us the people of a State where the
constitution gives the same weight to a smaller as to a greater
number, might take the remedy into their own hands; meaning,
as I understood him, that a mere majority might at their pleasure
subvert the constitution and government of a State,&mdash;which he
seemed to think was the essence of democracy. Our little State<span class="pagenum"><a id="page3095" name="page3095">3095</a></span>
has a constitution that could not stand a day against such doctrines,
and yet we glory in it as the best in the Union. It is a
constitution which respects all the great interests of the State,
giving to each a separate and distinct voice in the management
of its political affairs, by means of which the feebler interests are
protected against the preponderance of the stronger. We call our
State a Republic&mdash;a Commonwealth, not a Democracy; and let
me tell the Senator, it is a far more popular government than if
it had been based on the simple principle of the numerical
majority. It takes more voices to put the machine of government
in motion than in those that the Senator would consider
more popular. It represents all the interests of the State,&mdash;and
is in fact the government of the people in the true sense of the
term, and not that of the mere majority, or the dominant
interests.</p>

<p>I am not familiar with the constitution of Maryland, to which
the Senator alluded, and cannot therefore speak of its structure
with confidence; but I believe it to be somewhat similar in its
character to our own. That it is a government not without its
excellence, we need no better proof than the fact that though
within the shadow of Executive influence, it has nobly and successfully
resisted all the seductions by which a corrupt and artful
Administration, with almost boundless patronage, has attempted
to seduce her into its ranks.</p>

<p>Looking then to the approaching struggle, I take my stand
immovably. <i>I am a conservative in its broadest and fullest sense,
and such I shall ever remain, unless indeed the government shall
become so corrupt and disordered that nothing short of revolution
can reform it.</i> I solemnly believe that our political system is, in
its purity, not only the best that ever was formed, but the best
possible that can be devised for us. It is the only one by
which free States, so populous and wealthy, and occupying so
vast an extent of territory, can preserve their liberty. Thus
thinking, I cannot hope for a better. Having no hope of a better,
I am a conservative; and <i>because I am a conservative, I am a
State Rights man</i>. I believe that in the rights of the States are
to be found the only effectual means of checking the overaction
of this government; to resist its tendency to concentrate all
power here, and to prevent a departure from the Constitution;
or in case of one, to restore the government to its original simplicity
and purity. State interposition, or to express it more<span class="pagenum"><a id="page3096" name="page3096">3096</a></span>
fully, the right of a State to interpose her sovereign voice, as
one of the parties to our constitutional compact, against the encroachments
of this government, is the only means of sufficient
potency to effect all this; and I am therefore its advocate. I
rejoiced to hear the Senators from North Carolina [Mr. Brown],
and from Pennsylvania [Mr. Buchanan], do us the justice to distinguish
between nullification and the anarchical and revolutionary
movements in Maryland and Pennsylvania. I know they did
not intend it as a compliment; but I regard it as the highest.
They are right. Day and night are not more different&mdash;more
unlike in everything. They are unlike in their principles, their
objects, and their consequences.</p>

<p>I shall not stop to make good this assertion, as I might
easily do. The occasion does not call for it. As a conservative
and a State Rights man, or if you will have it, a nullifier, I
have resisted and shall resist all encroachments on the Constitution&mdash;whether
of this Government on the rights of the States,
or the opposite:&mdash;whether of the Executive on Congress, or
Congress on the Executive. My creed is to hold both governments,
and all the departments of each, to their proper sphere,
and to maintain the authority of the laws and the Constitution
against all revolutionary movements. I believe the means which
our system furnishes to preserve itself are ample, if fairly
understood and applied; and I shall resort to them, however
corrupt and disordered the times, so long as there is hope of
reforming the government. The result is in the hands of the
Disposer of events. It is my part to do my duty. Yet while I
thus openly avow myself a conservative, God forbid I should
ever deny the glorious right of rebellion and revolution. Should
corruption and oppression become intolerable, and not otherwise
be thrown off&mdash;if liberty must perish or the government be
overthrown, I would not hesitate, at the hazard of life, to resort
to revolution, and to tear down a corrupt government that could
neither be reformed nor borne by freemen. But I trust in God
things will never come to that pass. I trust never to see such
fearful times; for fearful indeed they would be, if they should
ever befall us. It is the last remedy, and not to be thought of
till common-sense and the voice of mankind would justify the
resort.</p>

<p>Before I resume my seat, I feel called on to make a few brief
remarks on a doctrine of fearful import which has been broached<span class="pagenum"><a id="page3097" name="page3097">3097</a></span>
in the course of this debate: the right to repeal laws granting
bank charters, and of course of railroads, turnpikes, and joint-stock
companies. It is a doctrine of fearful import, and calculated
to do infinite mischief. There are countless millions vested
in such stocks, and it is a description of property of the most
delicate character. To touch it is almost to destroy it. But
while I enter my protest against all such doctrines, I have been
greatly alarmed with the thoughtless precipitancy (not to use a
stronger phrase) with which the most extensive and dangerous
privileges have been granted of late. It can end in no good, and
I fear may be the cause of convulsions hereafter. We already
feel the effects on the currency, which no one competent of judging
can fail to see is in an unsound condition. I must say (for
truth compels me) I have ever distrusted the banking system, at
least in its present form, both in this country and Great Britain.
It will not stand the test of time; but I trust that all shocks or
sudden revolutions may be avoided, and that it may gradually
give way before some sounder and better regulated system of
credit which the growing intelligence of the age may devise.
That a better may be substituted I cannot doubt; but of what it
shall consist, and how it shall finally supersede the present uncertain
and fluctuating currency, time alone can determine. All
that I can see is, that the present must, one day or another,
come to an end or be greatly modified&mdash;if that indeed can save
it from an entire overthrow. It has within itself the seeds of its
own destruction.</p>

<h3><a name="ON_THE_GOVERNMENT_OF_POLAND" id="ON_THE_GOVERNMENT_OF_POLAND"></a><ins class="correction" title="Original was 'OF'">ON</ins> THE GOVERNMENT OF POLAND</h3>

<p class="subtitle">From 'A Disquisition on Government'</p>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="dcap">It is</span> then a great error to suppose that the government of the
concurrent majority is impracticable; or that it rests on a
feeble foundation. History furnishes many examples of such
governments; and among them one in which the principle was
carried to an extreme that would be thought impracticable, had
it never existed. I refer to that of Poland. In this it was
carried to such an extreme that in the election of her kings, the
concurrence or acquiescence of every individual of the nobles
and gentry present, in an assembly numbering usually from one
hundred and fifty to two hundred thousand, was required to<span class="pagenum"><a id="page3098" name="page3098">3098</a></span>
make a choice; thus giving to each individual a veto on his
election. So likewise every member of her Diet (the supreme
legislative body), consisting of the King, the Senate, bishops
and deputies of the nobility and gentry of the palatinates, possessed
a veto on all its proceedings; thus making a unanimous
vote necessary to enact a law or to adopt any measure whatever.
And as if to carry the principle to the utmost extent,
the veto of a single member not only defeated the particular
bill or measure in question, but prevented all others passed
during the session from taking effect. Further the principle
could not be carried. It in fact made every individual of the
nobility and gentry a distinct element in the organism; or to
vary the expression, made him an <i>estate of the kingdom</i>.
And yet this government lasted in this form more than two
centuries, embracing the period of Poland's greatest power and
renown. Twice during its existence she protected Christendom,
when in great danger, by defeating the Turks under the walls
of Vienna, and permanently arresting thereby the tide of their
conquests westward.</p>

<p>It is true her government was finally subverted, and the
people subjugated, in consequence of the extreme to which the
principle was carried; not however because of its tendency to
dissolution <i>from weakness</i>, but from the facility it afforded to
powerful and unscrupulous neighbors to control by their intrigues
the election of her kings. But the fact that a government
in which the principle was carried to the utmost extreme
not only existed, but existed for so long a period in great power
and splendor, is proof conclusive both of its practicability and
its compatibility with the power and permanency of government.</p>

<h3><a name="URGING_REPEAL_OF_THE_MISSOURI_COMPROMISE" id="URGING_REPEAL_OF_THE_MISSOURI_COMPROMISE"></a>URGING REPEAL OF THE MISSOURI COMPROMISE</h3>

<p class="subtitle">From Speech in the Senate, March 4th, 1850</p>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="dcap">Having</span> now shown what cannot save the Union, I return to
the question with which I commenced, How can the Union
be saved? There is but one way by which it can with
any certainty; and that is by a full and final settlement, on the
principle of justice, of all the questions at issue between the two
sections. The South asks for justice, simple justice, and less
she ought not to take. She has no compromise to offer but the<span class="pagenum"><a id="page3099" name="page3099">3099</a></span>
Constitution; and no concession or surrender to make. She has
already surrendered so much that she has little left to surrender.
Such a settlement would go to the root of the evil and
remove all cause of discontent; by satisfying the South, she
could remain honorably and safely in the Union, and thereby
restore the harmony and fraternal feelings between the sections
which existed anterior to the Missouri agitation. Nothing else
can with any certainty finally and forever settle the questions
at issue, terminate agitation, and save the Union.</p>

<p>But can this be done? Yes, easily; not by the weaker
party&mdash;for it can of itself do nothing, not even protect itself&mdash;but
by the stronger. The North has only to will it to accomplish
it; to do justice by conceding to the South an equal right
in the acquired territory, and to do her duty by causing the
stipulations relative to fugitive slaves to be faithfully fulfilled;
to cease the agitation of the slave question, and to provide for
the insertion of a provision in the Constitution by an amendment
which will restore to the South in substance the power
she possessed of protecting herself, before the equilibrium between
the sections was destroyed by the action of this government.
There will be no difficulty in devising such a provision,&mdash;one
that will protect the South, and which at the same time
will improve and strengthen the government instead of impairing
and weakening it.</p>

<p>But will the North agree to this? It is for her to answer the
question. But I will say she cannot refuse, if she has half the
love of the Union which she professes to have; or without justly
exposing herself to the charge that her love of power and
aggrandizement is far greater than her love of the Union. At
all events, the responsibility of saving the Union rests on the
North, and not on the South. The South cannot save it by any
act of hers, and the North may save it without any sacrifice
whatever; unless to do justice, and to perform her duties under
the Constitution, should be regarded by her as a sacrifice.</p>

<p>It is time, Senators, that there should be an open and manly
avowal on all sides as to what is intended to be done. If the
question is not now settled, it is uncertain whether it ever can
hereafter be; and we as the representatives of the States of this
Union, regarded as governments, should come to a distinct understanding
as to our respective views in order to ascertain
whether the great questions at issue can be settled or not. If<span class="pagenum"><a id="page3100" name="page3100">3100</a></span>
you who represent the stronger portion cannot agree to settle
them on the broad principle of justice and duty, say so; and let
the States we both represent agree to separate and part in
peace. If you are unwilling we should part in peace, tell us so,
and we shall know what to do when you reduce the question to
submission or resistance. If you remain silent you will compel
us to infer by your acts what you intend. In that case California
will become the test question. If you admit her, under all
the difficulties that oppose her admission, you compel us to infer
that you intend to exclude us from the whole of the acquired
territories, with the intention of destroying irretrievably the
equilibrium between the two sections. We would be blind not
to perceive in that case that your real objects are power and
aggrandizement; and infatuated not to act accordingly.</p>

<p>I have now, Senators, done my duty in expressing my opinions
fully, freely, and candidly, on this solemn occasion. In
doing so I have been governed by the motives which have governed
me in all the stages of the agitation of the slavery question
since its commencement. I have exerted myself during
the whole period to arrest it, with the intention of saving the
Union if it could be done; and if it could not, to save the section
where it has pleased Providence to cast my lot, and which
I sincerely believe has justice and the Constitution on its side.
Having faithfully done my duty to the best of my ability, both
to the Union and my section, throughout this agitation, I shall
have the consolation, let what will come, that I am free from
all responsibility.</p>

<h2><a name="CALLIMACHUS" id="CALLIMACHUS"></a>CALLIMACHUS</h2>

<p class="subtitle">(<span class="smcap">Third Century b.c.</span>)</p>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/cap_c.png" title="" alt="C" width="74" height="75" class="cap" />
<p class="cap_1"><span class="dcap">Callimachus</span>, the most learned of poets, was the son of Battus
and Mesatme of Cyrene, and a disciple of Hermocrates, who
like his more celebrated pupil was a grammarian, or a follower
of belles-lettres, says Suidas. It is in this calling that we first
hear of Callimachus, when he was a teacher at Alexandria. Here he
counted among his pupils Apollonius Rhodius, author of the 'Argonautica,'
and Eratosthenes, famous for his wisdom in science, who
knew geography and geometry so well that he measured the circumference
of the earth. Callimachus was in fact one of those erudite
poets and wise men of letters whom the gay Alexandrians who
thronged the court of Ptolemy Philadelphus called "The Pleiades."
Apollonius Rhodius, Aratus, Theocritus, Lycophron, Nicander, and
Homer son of Macro, were the other six. From his circle of clever
people, the king, with whom he had become a prime favorite, called
him to be chief custodian over the stores of precious books at Alexandria.
These libraries, we may recall, were the ones Julius CÃ¦sar
partially burned by accident a century later, and Bishop Theophilus
and his mob of Christian zealots finished destroying as repositories
of paganism some three centuries later still. The collections said to
have been destroyed by Caliph Omar when Amru took Alexandria in
640 <span class="smcap">a.d.</span>, on the ground that if they agreed with the Koran they
were superfluous and if they contradicted it they were blasphemous,
were later ones; but the whole story is discredited by modern scholarship.
The world has not ceased mourning for this untold and
irreparable loss of the choicest fruits of the human spirit.</p></div>

<p>Of all these precious manuscripts and parchments, then, Callimachus
was made curator about the year <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 260. Aulus Gellius
computes the time in this wise:&mdash;"Four-hundred-ninety years after
the founding of Rome, the first Punic war was begun, and not long
after, Callimachus, the poet of Cyrene in Alexandria, flourished at the
court of King Ptolemy." At this time he must have been already
married to the wife of whom Suidas speaks in his 'Lexicon,' a
daughter of a Syracusan gentleman.</p>

<p>The number of Callimachus's works, which are reported to have
reached eight hundred, testifies to his popularity in the Alexandrian
period of Greek literature. It contradicts also the maxim ascribed to
him, that "a great book is a great evil." Among the prose works<span class="pagenum"><a id="page3102" name="page3102">3102</a></span>
which would have enriched our knowledge of literature and history
was his history of Greek literature in one hundred and twenty books,
classifying the Greek writers and naming them chronologically. These
were the results of his long labors in the libraries. Among them
was a book on the Museum and the schools connected with it, with
records of illustrious educators and of the books they had written.</p>

<p>It is his poetry that has in the main survived, and yet as Ovid
says&mdash;calling him Battiades, either from his father's name or from
the illustrious founder of his native <span class="nowrap">Cyrene&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Battiades semper toto cantabitur orbe:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quamvis ingenio non valet, arte valet."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">(Even throughout all lands Battiades's name will be famous;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though not in genius supreme, yet by his art he excels.)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Quintilian, however, says he was the prince of Greek elegiac
poets. Of his elegies we have a few fragments, and also the Latin
translation by Catullus of the 'Lock of Berenice.' Berenice, the sister
and wife of Ptolemy Euergetes, who succeeded his father Philadelphus
in <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> 245, had sacrificed some of her hair, laying it on
the altar of a temple, from which it was subsequently stolen. In his
poem, Callimachus as the court poet sang how the gods had taken
the tresses and placed them among the stars. The delicate and
humorous 'Rape of the Lock' of Alexander Pope is a rather remote
repetition of the same fancy.</p>

<p>We have also from Callimachus's hand six hymns to the gods and
many epigrams, the latter of which, as will be seen by the quotations
given below, are models of their kind. His lyric hymns are, in reality,
rather epics in little. They are full of recondite information,
overloaded indeed with learning; elegant, nervous, and elaborate,
rather than easy-flowing, simple, and warm, like a genuine product
of the muse. Many of his epigrams grace the 'Greek Anthology.'</p>

<p>Among the best editions of Callimachus is that of Ernesti (1761).
The extant poems and fragments have been in part translated by
William Dodd (1755) and H.&nbsp;W. Tytler (1856). His scattered epigrams
have incited many to attempt their perfect phrasing.</p>

<h2><a name="CHARLES_STUART_CALVERLEY" id="CHARLES_STUART_CALVERLEY"></a>CHARLES STUART CALVERLEY</h2>

<p class="subtitle">(1831-1884)</p>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/cap_n.png" title="" alt="N" width="72" height="75" class="cap" />
<p class="cap_2"><span class="dcap">No one</span> ever attained greater fame with few, slight, and unserious
books than this English author. His name rests upon four
volumes only:&mdash;'Verses and Translations' (1862); 'Translations
into English and Latin' (1866); 'Theocritus Translated into
English Verse' (1869); and 'Fly-Leaves' (1872). 'Fly-Leaves' holds
a unique place in English literature. It is made up chiefly of parodies,
which combine the mocking spirit with clever imitations of the
style and affectations of familiar poets. They are witty; they are
humorous; they are good-natured; and they are artistic and extraordinarily
clever. His satirical banter shown in these verses&mdash;most
of which are real poems as well as parodies&mdash;has been classed as
"refined common-sense," and "the exuberant playfulness of a powerful
mind and tender and manly nature." It contains also independent
literary skits and <i>comiques</i> which are quite equal in merit to the
parodies.</p></div>

<p>Calverley was born at Martley, Worcestershire, December 22d,
1831, the son of the Rev. Henry Blayds, a descendant of an old
Yorkshire family named Calverley. In 1852 Mr. Blayds resumed the
name of Calverley, which had been dropped at the beginning of the
century. Calverley was more famous at Harrow for his marvelous
jumping and other athletic feats than for his studies, but even at
this period he showed great talent for translating from the classics,
and astonished every one by his gifts of memory. A few Latin
verses won for him the Balliol scholarship in 1850, and in the next
year he received at Oxford the Chancellor's prize for a Latin poem.</p>

<p>In 1852 he went to Cambridge, and shortly after won the Craven
scholarship, as well as numerous medals and prizes for his attainments
in Greek and Latin. This was the more remarkable inasmuch
as he was extremely indolent and very fond of society, preferring to
entertain his friends by his witty songs, his charming voice, his
clever caricatures&mdash;for he had talent with his pencil&mdash;and his
brilliant conversation, rather than to apply himself to routine work.
His comrades used to lock him into a room to make him work, and
even then he would outwit them by dashing off a witty parody or a
bit of impromptu verse. Among his literary <i>jeux d'esprit</i> was an
examination paper on 'Pickwick,' prepared as a Christmas joke in
exact imitation of a genuine "exam." The prizes, two first editions<span class="pagenum"><a id="page3108" name="page3108">3108</a></span>
of Pickwick, were won by W.&nbsp;W. Skeat, now famous as a philologist,
and Walter Besant, known to the public as a novelist.</p>

<p>Calverley remained in Cambridge as tutor and lecturer, and was
presently called to the bar. It seemed the irony of fate that the
famous athlete should receive an injury while skating which compelled
him to abandon his profession, and for seventeen years
practically abandon work. He died at Folkestone, on February 17th,
1884.</p>

<p>That he was adored by his friends, and possessed unusual qualities
of character as well as mind, may be seen in the memoir published
by Walter T. Sendall with the 'Literary Remains' (1885).
Apart from his wit, Calverley has a distinct claim to remembrance
on account of his remarkable scholarship. His translations from
Greek and Latin have won the enthusiastic admiration of specialists
and students of the classics. Dr. Gunson, tutor of his college, an
accomplished Latinist, declared that he thought Calverley's Horatian
verse better than Horace's, being equally poetical, and more distinguished
in style. These works not only attest his mastery of
ancient languages, but also his acquaintance with the beauty and
capacity of English verse, into which he has put a grace of his own.
His numerous renderings of Latin into English and English into
Latin show his ease and dexterity of both thought and touch, and
his translation of Theocritus is considered by authorities to be a
masterpiece of literary workmanship.</p>

<h2>Full Contents of Smith Letter</h2>

<p><a name="Smith-Letter" id="Smith-Letter"></a>Respected and Honored Madam:</p>

<p>Having long and vainly sought an
opportunity to convey to you the expression
of my sentiments, I now avail myself
of the privilege of epistolary communication
to acquaint you with the fact that the
Emotions, which you have raised in my
breast, are those which should point to
Connubial Love and Affection rather
than to simple Friendship. In short,
Madam, I have the Honor to approach you
with a Proposal, the acceptance of which
will fill me with ecstatic Gratitude,
and enable me to extend to you those
Protecting Cares, which the Matrimonial
Bond makes at once the Duty and the
Privilege of him, who would, at no
distant date, lead to the Hymeneal
Altar one whose charms and virtues should
suffice to kindle its Flames, without
extraneous Aid</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

 I cannot conceive what made the accurate Niebuhr fall into the strange
error that "apparitions are unknown in Arabia." Arabs fear to sleep alone,
to enter the bath at night, to pass by cemeteries during dark, and to sit
amongst ruins, simply for fear of apparitions. And Arabia, together with
Persia, has supplied half the Western World&mdash;Southern Europe&mdash;with its
ghost stories and tales of angels, demons, and fairies. To quote Milton, the
land is struck "with superstition as with a planet."</p>
